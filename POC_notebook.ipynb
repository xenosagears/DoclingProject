This reinforced a desire to develop a more pragmatic approach, one which targets resilient businesses across the growth spectrum which are priced attractively relative to their growth profile (how Antipodes defines company value), making it more adaptable to different market environments. Antipodes' 'pragmatic value' approach utilizes a contemporary combination of fundamental, bottom -up analysis with an awareness of top-down factors and sophisticated use of quantitative investment tools including:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Considering structural growth and not solely cyclical mean reversion;\n",
      "- Insisting upon 'multiple ways of winning' at the stock level, which helps avoid value traps and seeks to benefit from macro and style headwinds as well as more traditional idiosyncratic stock-level fundamentals; and\n",
      "- Focusing on uncorrelated alpha clusters at the portfolio level, which helps avoid overexposure to certain geographies, sectors and/or macro/style factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing portfolios through the 2007-2008 market turmoil reinforced Jacob's belief in the importance of having truly uncorrelated sources of alpha in a portfolio. During times of market crisis or market volatility, stocks which appear uncorrelated can start moving as one for long periods of time -potentially they share the same end customers or are exposed to the same style or macro risks.\n",

      "## 4.7 Describe your investment style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes defines our investment style as 'Pragmatic value'. This approach acknowledges both structural and cyclical change and defines value investing as paying the right price for growth and business resilience. Antipodes invests across the continuum of low to high growth but always seek to pay an attractive multiple. Antipodes is agnostic as to the level of growth as long as the multiple paid reflects this trade-off. Antipodes believes conventional value is too dependent on cyclical mean reversion frameworks, which when applied in isolation of a structural change framework, may lead to 'value traps'.\n",

Antipodes also compares this relative multiple to the historical relative multiple versus the market (and region/sector) as a final sense check.

The market's tendency to irrationally respond to ESG factors can result in both downside risks and upside opportunities and, as an active manager, we seek to generate returns from both situations. Our investment process includes consideration of ESG principles, risks and opportunities in the same framework that we consider all risks and opportunities. We do this for the benefit of our investors, with the hope that we are also contributing to a more stable, sustainable and inclusive global economy.\n",

      "At the AGM in November 2023, Antipodes voted against management on several items. Oracle has failed to respond to long-time shareholder concerns around compensation arrangements and we have used our votes to send a message to the board that more needs to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Antipodes withheld votes to re-elect directors Awo Ablo, Jeffery S Berg, Michael J Boskin, Safra A Catz, Bruce R Chizen, George H Conrades, Lawrence J Ellison, Rona A Fairhead, Jeffrey O Henley, Renee J James, Charles W Moorman, Leon E Panetta, William G Parrett, Naomi O Seligman and Vishal Sikka. A decision to withhold votes is justified for incumbent members of the board (there are no new members proposed for this year) due to multiple consecutive years of insufficient responsiveness to low say-on-pay vote results. This voting decision sends a strong message to the board that shareholder concerns continue to be unaddressed by the compensation committee.\n",
      "- Antipodes also voted against the advisory vote to ratify named executive officer's compensation. This proposal has received less than 70% support for 12 consecutive years. Despite this, there has been no substantive change to the executive pay program to address shareholder concerns. The specific concern is that the annual equity grants to certain NEOs (excluding Catz and Ellison) do not utilise performanceconditioned equity and vest solely over time -a process that is inconsistent with prevailing market practices.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against management's proposal to amend the omnibus stock plan. In our view, a vote against this proposal is justified given the equity program is estimated to be excessively dilutive (assuming maximum dilution, the plan could account for ~20% of shares outstanding). In addition, the plan is excessively costly, has an excessively high three-year average burn rate and allows broad discretion to accelerate vesting.\n",
      "- Finally, Antipodes voted against management and for a shareholder proposal for a report on median and adjusted gender/racial pay gaps. In our view this report would allow shareholders to better evaluate the progress of the company's diversity and inclusive initiatives and management of any related risks.\n",

      "\n",
      "During the first quarter of 2023, we engaged with the company ahead of the reopening of its Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea on both environmental and social issues. Engagement in this instance was first via email with the company Investor Relations and later via video conference with company's Group Sustainability Executive Grant Beringer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Porgera mine operates in a complex social setting in remote PNG and also practices river-based tailings disposals. Porgera mine is one of only three mines left in the world - all of which are in PNG - to still use this tailings method, which results in large amounts of sediment flowing into natural water sources. Consequently, Sustainalytics has placed Barrick on its Global Standards Screening watchlist. Along with the environmental impact of these actions, they have also resulted in reputational impact for the company. We wanted to understand if there a plan of action to reduce the impact of the current tailings disposal system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engagement also included a discussion on the company's plans to implement improved social and environmental programs at the Porgera mine. We noted to the company that over the years, there had been a number of complaints and negative commentary around the use of security forces at Porgera, specifically the interactions between artisanal miners, security forces and the local community. We asked Barrick whether there would be any improvements in the frameworks with respect to security to minimize risks to all parties and for details of those frameworks. We also communicated to Barrick that Antipodes expects to see increased and improved action on community funding in conjunction with a renewed ownership structure in which local stakeholders will own a larger portion of the mine.\n",

      "\n",
      "During the meeting we focused on the restart of Barrick's Porgera operations and the company's reintegration with the local community. Barrick pointed to the company's strong relations with the PNG government as being critical in strengthening the relationship with the community and maintaining security against illegal miners where necessary.\n",

      "The conversation also turned to the proposed Reko Diq site in Pakistan, where we delved into water availability, as well as community relationship programs in the region. Barrick again spoke of the actions it had taken to develop strong government and community relationships to enhance the success of the mine. We took the opportunity to communicate our concerns around the unique community and social factors relevant to the particular region of Reko Diq site.\n",

      "Also during the Q1 24 meeting, we discussed in detail the company's compensation plans. At the 2023 AGM, the company received a 77% approval rate on the say on pay proposal, which was considered low. In response Barrick updated and simplified the compensation program and our discussions focused on the key amendments in the new program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes also voted against management on three items at Barrick's annual meeting in April 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against the proposal to approve the continued appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and to authorise the board to fix their remuneration. Whilst it is not a legal requirement for TSX listed companies it is best practice to rotate auditors and avoid excessive tenure. In this instance, PWC has been auditor since 1983.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against the advisory vote on executive compensation approach. This vote is in line with our prior engagement with the company. In particular, the length of the compensation programs will not cover the period of investment the company is about to undertake with Reko Diq. Whilst there has been some improvement with transparency, the compensation system needs to better reflect and align with a risky greenfield investment program out to 2030.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted for a shareholder proposal to commission an independent third-party audit of environmental water impacts. A vote for this item goes against management's recommendation. Barrick has faced increased scrutiny on water and community impacts. As such further third-party studies would help to ascertain the full impacts of the company's increased focus on community engagement and reduced environmental impact and alleviate concerns.\n",
      "\n",

During the period of the merger discussions there were risks to minority equity holders resulting from the divergent views of the two shareholders, despite board                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

      "\n",
      "In Q3 2022 we updated our investment case for Saint Gobain, a company in our investment universe and a prior holding. Saint Gobain is the global leader in light and sustainable construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saint-Gobain is a key beneficiary of the plethora of global government regulations and stimulus packages targeted at driving progress towards net zero. One example is the successful MaPrimeRenov programme in France, which incentivises renovations, as well as evolving minimum energy efficiency standards. The implications of not meeting such standards are severe, with substantial fines and restrictions on renting or selling unrenovated properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2022, we engaged with the company's investor relations team as part of the investment process. The team highlighted Saint Gobain's strong ESG credentials - sustainable construction is essential to a net-zero carbon economy. Private and public buildings are the biggest source of carbon emissions at 40%, more than industry and transport. Saint Gobain's renovation solutions are being targeted via stimulus packages and new building regulations as part of a global drive for greener, more sustainable buildings. Within this, insulation offers the highest energy efficiency returns versus alternative offerings. Saint Gobain's exposure to light and sustainable construction saves resources, time and cost versus heavy construction and enables faster construction of buildings that are needed in emerging markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "By September 2023, not only had we made Saint Gobain a portfolio holding, but we were also hosting the company's CEO on our podcast. During the podcast recording, CEO, Benoit Bazin stated that 90% of buildings in Europe would need to be renovated by 2050 for the region to reach carbon neutrality. This would require a 3x increase in the rate of renovations. With around 75% of its products relating to sustainability and the only company to offer an infinitely recyclable plasterboard, Saint Gobain is well positioned to benefit from the regulatory requirements.\n",

      "The Antipodes Global Long Strategy's objective is to outperform the MSCI All Country World Net Index in USD over the investment cycle (typically 3-5 years)\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes' investment philosophy is based upon the significant experience of CIO Jacob Mitchell. Over his long career Jacob observed that more traditional, dogmatic value approaches -those generally wedded to low multiple names -can overemphasize mean reversion and result in very episodic alpha generation when 'value' as a factor outperforms. This reinforced a desire to develop a more pragmatic approach, one which targets resilient businesses across the growth spectrum which are priced attractively relative to their growth profile (how Antipodes defines company value), making it more adaptable to different market environments. Antipodes' 'pragmatic value' approach utilizes a contemporary combination of fundamental, bottom -up analysis with an awareness of top-down factors and sophisticated use of quantitative investment tools including:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Considering structural growth and not solely cyclical mean reversion;\n",
      "- Insisting upon 'multiple ways of winning' at the stock level, which helps avoid value traps and seeks to benefit from macro and style headwinds as well as more traditional idiosyncratic stock-level fundamentals; and\n",
      "- Focusing on uncorrelated alpha clusters at the portfolio level, which helps avoid overexposure to certain geographies, sectors and/or macro/style factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing portfolios through the 2007-2008 market turmoil reinforced Jacob's belief in the importance of having truly uncorrelated sources of alpha in a portfolio. During times of market crisis or market volatility, stocks which appear uncorrelated can start moving as one for long periods of time -potentially they share the same end customers or are exposed to the same style or macro risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.7 Describe your investment style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes defines our investment style as 'Pragmatic value'. This approach acknowledges both structural and cyclical change and defines value investing as paying the right price for growth and business resilience. Antipodes invests across the continuum of low to high growth but always seek to pay an attractive multiple. Antipodes is agnostic as to the level of growth as long as the multiple paid reflects this trade-off. Antipodes believes conventional value is too dependent on cyclical mean reversion frameworks, which when applied in isolation of a structural change framework, may lead to 'value traps'.\n",

      "## Philosophy:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pragmatic Value -Antipodes invests across the spectrum of low to high growth businesses, paying the right price for growth and business resilience. Antipodes delivers an 'all weather' value approach that avoids being hostage to the typical value/growth cycle, and the episodic return profiles of some value managers. Antipodes believes conventional value is too dependent on cyclical mean reversion frameworks, which when applied in isolation of a structural change framework, may lead to 'value traps'.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Process:\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry-led research -Deep industry analysis and longer-term perspective leads to proprietary insights and contrarian investment cases. Antipodes devotes significant time to considering how key industries will look in 510 years and what the potential non-linear changes are. This allows us to anticipate changes in competitive dynamics and product cycles ahead of the market and is critical to establishing a margin of safety at the stock level. Furthermore, Antipodes finds that an industry-led approach is more likely to lead to breakthroughs in establishing contrarian perspectives to the market and often identifies a cluster of ideas at the single stock level that results in an efficient use of research resources. This results in high conviction portfolios without excessive concentration.\n",

Antipodes has a dedicated Quantitative Systems and Macroeconomic team (Quant and Macro team) that is integrated in each stage of the investment process which includes identification, analysis and portfolio construction. This aids capital preservation and improves risk adjusted returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Organizational Design:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sector team/model portfolio approach - the repeatability and success of our investment process is driven by transparency, the right blend between structure and flexibility, and emphasis on the team. For example, the stepby-step transparent flow from idea generation to sector team model portfolios and then to the final portfolio ensures that all team members are aware of how their contribution fits into the overall process and final portfolio.\n",

      "\n",
      "Further as a value manager, Antipodes is also cognizant of the Strategy's performance relative to the MSCI Value index (MSCI Value) and global value peers. The Strategy has outperformed (USD, gross) MSCI Value Index by +3.4% p.a., and has outperformed many of the Strategy's value peers, demonstrating strong performance against eVestment's All -Cap Value equity peer group which includes over 200 global value managers.\n",

      "As an example, Antipodes Global Long Strategy's delivered its best absolute performance during 2017 of +31.70% (USD) and +7.72% alpha relative to MSCI ACWI Index (USD).

      "\n",
      "The Global Long Strategy has underperformed when markets typically decouple from valuation and are willing to pay for 'growth at any price', leading to artificially elevated multiples, i.e. the post -covid period.

      "Currency is actively managed within the Strategy for risk management purposes, however not hedged back into any underlying currency. Antipodes' starting point is the underlying currency exposure from long equity holdings within the portfolio. Antipodes' Quant and Macro team maintain a relative currency attractiveness model of every currency in the world. This is used to compare to underlying equity exposure, whereby active positioning may take place based on relative attractiveness.

The market's tendency to irrationally respond to ESG factors can result in both downside risks and upside opportunities and, as an active manager, we seek to generate returns from both situations. Our investment process includes consideration of ESG principles, risks and opportunities in the same framework that we consider all risks and opportunities.

      "- Antipodes withheld votes to re-elect directors Awo Ablo, Jeffery S Berg, Michael J Boskin, Safra A Catz, Bruce R Chizen, George H Conrades, Lawrence J Ellison, Rona A Fairhead, Jeffrey O Henley, Renee J James, Charles W Moorman, Leon E Panetta, William G Parrett, Naomi O Seligman and Vishal Sikka. A decision to withhold votes is justified for incumbent members of the board (there are no new members proposed for this year) due to multiple consecutive years of insufficient responsiveness to low say-on-pay vote results. This voting decision sends a strong message to the board that shareholder concerns continue to be unaddressed by the compensation committee.\n",

Despite this, there has been no substantive change to the executive pay program to address shareholder concerns. The specific concern is that the annual equity grants to certain NEOs (excluding Catz and Ellison) do not utilise performanceconditioned equity and vest solely over time -a process that is inconsistent with prevailing market practices.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against management's proposal to amend the omnibus stock plan. In our view, a vote against this proposal is justified given the equity program is estimated to be excessively dilutive (assuming maximum dilution, the plan could account for ~20% of shares outstanding). In addition, the plan is excessively costly, has an excessively high three-year average burn rate and allows broad discretion to accelerate vesting.\n",

      "Antipodes has a track record of constructive engagement with Barrick, which spans environmental, social and governance matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first quarter of 2023, we engaged with the company ahead of the reopening of its Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea on both environmental and social issues. Engagement in this instance was first via email with the company Investor Relations and later via video conference with company's Group Sustainability Executive Grant Beringer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Porgera mine operates in a complex social setting in remote PNG and also practices river-based tailings disposals. Porgera mine is one of only three mines left in the world - all of which are in PNG - to still use this tailings method, which results in large amounts of sediment flowing into natural water sources. Consequently, Sustainalytics has placed Barrick on its Global Standards Screening watchlist. Along with the environmental impact of these actions, they have also resulted in reputational impact for the company. We wanted to understand if there a plan of action to reduce the impact of the current tailings disposal system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engagement also included a discussion on the company's plans to implement improved social and environmental programs at the Porgera mine. We noted to the company that over the years, there had been a number of complaints and negative commentary around the use of security forces at Porgera, specifically the interactions between artisanal miners, security forces and the local community. We asked Barrick whether there would be any improvements in the frameworks with respect to security to minimize risks to all parties and for details of those frameworks. We also communicated to Barrick that Antipodes expects to see increased and improved action on community funding in conjunction with a renewed ownership structure in which local stakeholders will own a larger portion of the mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "<page_break>\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued our engagement with Barrick in the first quarter of 2024 in a conversation with the company's Group Sustainability Executive and Chair of the Compensation Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the meeting we focused on the restart of Barrick's Porgera operations and the company's reintegration with the local community. Barrick pointed to the company's strong relations with the PNG government as being critical in strengthening the relationship with the community and maintaining security against illegal miners where necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation also turned to the proposed Reko Diq site in Pakistan, where we delved into water availability, as well as community relationship programs in the region. Barrick again spoke of the actions it had taken to develop strong government and community relationships to enhance the success of the mine. We took the opportunity to communicate our concerns around the unique community and social factors relevant to the particular region of Reko Diq site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also during the Q1 24 meeting, we discussed in detail the company's compensation plans. At the 2023 AGM, the company received a 77% approval rate on the say on pay proposal, which was considered low. In response Barrick updated and simplified the compensation program and our discussions focused on the key amendments in the new program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes also voted against management on three items at Barrick's annual meeting in April 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against the proposal to approve the continued appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and to authorise the board to fix their remuneration. Whilst it is not a legal requirement for TSX listed companies it is best practice to rotate auditors and avoid excessive tenure. In this instance, PWC has been auditor since 1983.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against the advisory vote on executive compensation approach. This vote is in line with our prior engagement with the company. In particular, the length of the compensation programs will not cover the period of investment the company is about to undertake with Reko Diq. Whilst there has been some improvement with transparency, the compensation system needs to better reflect and align with a risky greenfield investment program out to 2030.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted for a shareholder proposal to commission an independent third-party audit of environmental water impacts. A vote for this item goes against management's recommendation. Barrick has faced increased scrutiny on water and community impacts. As such further third-party studies would help to ascertain the full impacts of the company's increased focus on community engagement and reduced environmental impact and alleviate concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are pleased to see that the company has taken action on the topics we have engaged upon, across compensation plans, community engagement and environmental matters. We will continue to engage with the company on each of these items as we believe that more can be done.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2023 the CDP revised the campaign process slightly. While supporters could continue to nominate which companies they would like to take the role of primary signatory/lead engager on, all supporters were automatically assigned as co-signatories to every engagement letter sent. This is the same process for the 2024 campaign, which Antipodes is currently participating in and at the time of writing remains ongoing.\n",

Simultaneously, stresses resulting from climate risk pose a further threat.

We first engaged with Boohoo's CEO and CFO in October 2020 to understand how the company planned to remediate their supply chain issues. Soon after the company pledged to increase transparency, improve governance, build a manufacturing centre of excellence and published the results of an independent review. Throughout 2020 and 2021 we continued to engage with the company on ESG and are pleased with Boohoo's recent decision to yield to consumer demand, committing to using 100% sustainably sourced products by 2025 and to improve recycling of clothing.

Facing this impasse, it culminated in a termination of the agreement in early 2023 and subsequently Frontline purchasing assets directly from Euronav.

      "\n",
      "Saint-Gobain is a key beneficiary of the plethora of global government regulations and stimulus packages targeted at driving progress towards net zero. One example is the successful MaPrimeRenov programme in France, which incentivises renovations, as well as evolving minimum energy efficiency standards. The implications of not meeting such standards are severe, with substantial fines and restrictions on renting or selling unrenovated properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2022, we engaged with the company's investor relations team as part of the investment process. The team highlighted Saint Gobain's strong ESG credentials - sustainable construction is essential to a net-zero carbon economy. Private and public buildings are the biggest source of carbon emissions at 40%, more than industry and transport. Saint Gobain's renovation solutions are being targeted via stimulus packages and new building regulations as part of a global drive for greener, more sustainable buildings. Within this, insulation offers the highest energy efficiency returns versus alternative offerings. Saint Gobain's exposure to light and sustainable construction saves resources, time and cost versus heavy construction and enables faster construction of buildings that are needed in emerging markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "By September 2023, not only had we made Saint Gobain a portfolio holding, but we were also hosting the company's CEO on our podcast. During the podcast recording, CEO, Benoit Bazin stated that 90% of buildings in Europe would need to be renovated by 2050 for the region to reach carbon neutrality. This would require a 3x increase in the rate of renovations. With around 75% of its products relating to sustainability and the only company to offer an infinitely recyclable plasterboard, Saint Gobain is well positioned to benefit from the regulatory requirements.\n",
