In its analysis, the firm considers several factors including the liquidity characteristics of each capitalization tier, the size (market float) of individual stocks and the overall market relative to the firm's strategy. As well, CC&amp;L recognizes that there is overlap across mandates; the assets in any one strategy may affect capacity availability for its other strategies. For example, emerging market mandates infringe on capacity of other foreign mandates; the same can be said for  small  cap  mandates  relative  to  large  cap  mandates.

In June 2019, the stewardship and engagement (S&amp;E) team was created to support CC&amp;L on exercising its rights as owners.  The S&amp;E team provides support to CC&amp;L's analysts and  portfolio  managers  to  more  proactively  engage  with  investee  companies,  collaborate  with  likeminded  investors  and  facilitate  proxy  voting.  An  S&amp;E  Policy  was  created  at  the  same  time  to  guide CC&amp;L's  engagement  and  collaboration  activities.

This policy is reviewed annually and was most recently updated in 2021 to increase focus on some key governance and environmental themes; specifically, gender diversity, auditor tenure, and climate risk. CC&amp;L makes a concerted effort to ensure all votes reflect the firm's views on these issues.

Please note if the bonus (or part of it) vests over a certain period and how it is invested during this vesting period.\n",

      "The key investment professionals are business owners in the firm and not directly rewarded for performance or revenues.

      "\n",
      "CC&amp;L's compensation structure is specifically designed to attract, motivate and retain talented professionals. All senior  professionals  receive  a  base  salary  and  participate  directly  in  the  success  of  the  firm  through  equity ownership, the magnitude of which is tied to each individual's contribution to the overall success of the business. As responsibility and contribution are increased over time, ownership is also increased. Investment professionals who  are  not  yet  equity  owners  receive  competitive  salaries  and  bonuses.  In  2011,  CC&amp;L  created  a  new compensation program, 'Principal Program', which is intended to provide another layer of investment personnel (non-partners) with many of the same incentive and retention dynamics created through the ownership structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buy-in and earn-out of ownership interests takes place over an extended period of time and individuals are not required to put up cash to buy equity. The equity that is earned represents non-cash compensation for each individual and is earned over a period of nine years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon retirement, the value of their ownership interest is paid out over nine years. This provides a clear incentive for  the  retiree  to  ensure  that  succession  arrangements  are  in  place  to  promote  the  ongoing  health  of  the organization and to ensure that the organization can successfully achieve client objectives going forward.\n",

      "The firm offers competitive  benefits packages and a flexible, team-oriented  work environment. This creates a collegial atmosphere that employees appreciate and reward with their loyalty. In addition, the fact that the firm is employee-owned, and that all investment professionals may be eligible for ownership, is a substantial incentive for employees to remain with the firm.\n",

As a reminder, individuals are not required  to  put  up  cash  to  purchase  equity.  Equity  ownership  is  'earned  in'  through  a  sharing  of  cash  flows between the buyer and the seller over a period of 9 years. This mechanism provides a clear incentive for the selling  individual  to  ensure  that  succession  arrangements  are  in  place  to  promote  the  ongoing  health  of  the organization and to ensure that the organization can successfully achieve client objectives going forward.\n",

      "\n",
      "Succession planning is an important process at CC&amp;L. There is a commitment on the part of the firm whereby deserving professionals increase responsibility, accountability and equity ownership over time. Investment teams have  grown  steadily  with  the  addition  of  seasoned  industry  professionals,  blended  with  recent  university graduates who bring to CC&amp;L well-developed analytical skills. Each year, ownership is reviewed and deserving individuals are given the opportunity to gradually increase their ownership as their contribution to the business grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Succession  plans  have  been  very  well  executed.  Current  team  leaders  are  all  from  the  second  and  third generation of business owners and their economic interest in the business is greater than that of the founding generation. The firm is also enjoying significant contribution from the third and fourth generation of key decision makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment professionals at CC&amp;L work in integrated team environments using highly structured investment processes.  As  a  result,  the  departure  of  any  individual  team  member  would  have  little  material  impact  on investment strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example of CC&amp;L's approach to managing succession, in January 2013, Martin Gerber, who was Head of the Quantitative Equity Team succeeded Larry Lunn as President of the firm. Larry stayed on with the firm as Chairman and as a member of the Asset Allocation Team until his retirement in March of 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "As another example, in the spring of 2014, CC&amp;L announced that Steven Huang, a senior portfolio manager who managed research on the Quantitative Equity Team (Q team), would become Head of the Q team in 2016. The transition from Martin Gerber to Steven progressed as planned, with Steven taking on additional leadership and operational  responsibilities.  Steven  Huang  was  promoted  to  Director  in  2014.  Leadership  was  officially transferred to Steven in January 2016. This change created opportunities for others on the team to step forward and assume additional responsibilities which has helped to broaden the leadership within this growing team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, with the growth of the team to investment professionals, CC&amp;L completed a review of the team structure in 2021 and identified a need for additional leadership resources as the scope and complexity of this part of the firm's business has grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "CC&amp;L concluded that the team would benefit from a co-leadership structure where Jennifer Drake, a Director at CC&amp;L and portfolio manager on the Quantitative Equity team would take on a co-head role alongside Steven Huang. Jennifer will retain her investment role within the portfolio management team and broaden her focus to business and team strategy.

      "## Investment Philosophy and Process\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.6 Describe your investment philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the Q team's investment philosophy is that equity prices are set by the growth, valuation and quality fundamentals of their companies over the long term. However, the market process by which prices accurately reflect these fundamentals is not perfect with a number of behavioral, informational and structural hurdles and frictions that can prevent stock prices from efficiently reflecting these fundamentals. This results in mis-pricings in the marketplace that offer opportunities to add value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustainable and differentiated alpha can be generated by focusing on the evaluation of both fundamentals as well  as  opportunities  created by mis-pricings. While  the importance  of fundamentals as well as the impact of market inefficiencies is widely understood and accepted by the industry and academic literature, the Q team has developed  a  unique  model  that  applies  a  rigorous  and  systematic  approach  to  measuring  not  only  the fundamentals  of  businesses,  but  also  inefficiencies  that  result  in  temporary  stock  price  dislocations  and  the creation of investment opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team's success as a systematic manager is equally dependent on having sound investment intuition and leading-edge  technologies  for  analysis  and  computation.  Because  of  this,  both  technology  and  investment professionals work side-by-side in a fully collaborative team environment. The Q team's technology leaders are equal partners at the table for strategic decision-making and the dedicated technology professionals sit directly alongside the research and PM teams in designing and building CC&amp;L's investment processes.\n",

      "## General Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Q  team's  investment  approach  is  structured  around  a  systematic  forecast  model  that  quantitatively assesses  opportunities  in  stocks  based  on  the  team's  investment  philosophy  and  uses  these  forecasts  in  a disciplined  and  risk  managed  portfolio  management  process.  The  model  is  primarily  structural  in  nature  and factor based.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment universe comprises approximately 18,000 securities, 160 industry groups and 50 developed and emerging countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below  is  a  description  of  each  of  the  three  primary  components  of  the  daily  investment  process:  1)  Return Forecasts, 2) Risk Assessments, and 3) Transaction Cost Forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Return Forecasts\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Q  team's  return  forecast  model  analyzes  key  market  drivers  that  the  team  understands  to  drive  stock, industry,  and  country  returns.  For  each  security,  a  12-month  return  forecast  is  generated  by  each  individual indicator.  The  return  forecast  model  includes  over  70  indicators  which  are  designed  to  be  additive.  Similar indicators are aggregated into factor groups, which are the inputs into the team's return forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting  on  the  philosophy,  that  sustainable  and  differentiated  alpha  can  be  generated  by  focusing  on  the evaluation of both fundamentals as well as opportunities created by mis-pricings, the team has established two broad categories of indicators within its return forecast framework: Fundamentals and Opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Return Analysis Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fundamentals\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental  drivers  include  the  Q  team's  proprietary  indicators  that  capture  the  fundamental  attributes  of growth,  valuation,  and  quality  of  companies.  These  indicators  are  derived  from  both  market  data  as  well  as information  from  financial  statements  and  analyst  reports.  Importantly,  these  attributes  are  measured  using global data sets and comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "The model gauges the growth outlook for each stock by evaluating various indicators of growth potential for the company, including the expected impact of industry and country trends. These indicators are short to medium term in nature and measure the trends in reported data as well as forecasted expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indicator Example: Industry Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicator assesses relative growth by measuring global trends in industries. The Q team measures these trends  at  seven  levels  of  industry  aggregation  ranging  from  the  top  level,  consisting  of  11  broadly  defined industries, to the most detailed seventh level that includes over 1,400 different industries. The team controls for systematic tilts within an industry, such as capitalization or volatility, in the team's estimation of trends. The Q team constructs estimates of how each of these global trends influence the growth path of each stock based on their exposure and sensitivity to each industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional  examples  of  growth  indicators  include  stock  specific  and  country  trends,  fundamental  growth,  and market sentiment themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Value\n",
      "\n",
      "An assessment is made to determine if a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its peers. More specifically, the Q team's value indicators evaluate projections of a company's profits in relation to the current market value. This analysis encompasses several different indicators of value with a balance between cash flow and asset-based indicators. For stock-level valuations, shared influences such  as industry and  regional effects are removed to enable companies to be more appropriately compared to their peers. Finally, the model dynamically considers the breadth (or spread) of relative valuations and adjusts forecasts accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indicator Example: Earnings Yield\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicator compares the market value of a company to the ability of the company to generate earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Value characteristics are evaluated at a stock, industry, and country level.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality measures how efficiently a company uses its capital as well as how aggressive or conservative it is in reporting its financial results. These indicators gauge the quality or sustainability of the underlying business.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indicator Example: Capital Efficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "This  indicator  captures  the  tendency  for  companies  to  invest  in  the  best  projects  first  and  to  degrade  their profitability  as  they  make  further  investments  in  lesser  projects.  It  favors  companies  that  are  frugal  with  their capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "As a group, the Q team's proprietary Opportunity indicators (collectively, Opportunity Framework) recognize that while  all  business  are  affected  by  the  economic  and  market  environment  and  while  fundamental  analysis  is equally important for all stocks, the efficiency with which stocks incorporate this fundamental information varies considerably  across  the  market,  given  the  unique  characteristics  of  each  company  and  its  stock.  These inefficiencies  result  from  investors  not  fully  exploiting,  on  a  timely  basis,  information  that  is  relevant  to  stock prices due to limited attention and information processing capacity. Regulatory and market frictions also create structural  opportunities by creating hurdles or impediments to efficient price discovery by market participants. The team's Opportunity Framework is central to its ability to objectively and systematically measure how each individual  security  is  priced  in  the  market  and  as  a  result  what  fundamental  information  has  not  yet  been reflected in the share price by quantifying key stock and market specific metrics that are highly related to these opportunities (e.g., investor attention or 'efficiency').\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussed  in  more  detail  below,  there  are  three  primary  factor  groups  within  the  Opportunity  Framework: Efficiency, Complexity, and Structural.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Efficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "Efficiency indicators identify the varying level of attention investors pay to different companies and the impact this attention has on the significance and rate with which the future prices of companies are expected to respond to  new  information.  These  indicators  systematically  assess  the  'efficiency'  with  which  relevant  fundamental information is incorporated into the share price of each company in the Q team's investment universe. Stocks that are below average in efficiency generally take longer to respond to new fundamental information and as a result, offer more attractive alpha opportunities (and vice versa for stocks with above average efficiency).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "Above  is  discussed  how  Efficiency  measures  focus  on  attention  paid  to  different  companies.  The  team's Complexity indicators take the same concept but shift the focus from attention paid to companies, to attention paid to  data. These indicators capture the challenges investors face  with identifying, obtaining, or processing fundamental data that is relevant to the price of a security. These challenges include impediments in accessing data,  difficulties  processing  certain  types  of  data,  non-linear  relationships  in  data,  as  well  as  complex,  multivariate relationships within datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structural\n",
      "\n",
      "Structural indicators capture  technical impediments that limit the ability  for investors  to reflect their insights  in stock  prices.  These  impediments  exist  due  to  market  limitations  or  regulatory  frictions  and  are  conceptually related to the ability to transact in a security (market access), transaction cost, borrow cost, investor type, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Assessments\n",
      "\n",
      "A disciplined risk management process is critical in the Q team's endeavor to deliver consistent excess returns for its clients. The risk management framework ensures that the team takes investment risk only when warranted by an attractive investment return, and otherwise seeks to minimize uncompensated risk exposure in portfolios. Within the process, risk management involves not only the monitoring of portfolio holdings but, more importantly, the direct integration of risk assessments into portfolio construction, ensuring that portfolio risk is calibrated to operate within mandate constraints in the context of the prevailing capital market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, the Q team has developed a proprietary risk model instead of relying on a third-party risk model. A proprietary risk model is important because, recognizing there is 'no free lunch,' it allows the team to develop risk  factors  that  fully  capture  the  risks  associated  with  its  proprietary  alpha  forecasts,  which  would  not  be measured well by an external model. As a result, the Q team can maintain a more optimal assessment of true\n",
      "\n",
      "portfolio risk. In addition, as the return forecast model is enhanced, the risk model can be calibrated and updated to reflect the changes at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  addition  to  measuring alpha-related risks, the risk model also  assesses known  systematic risks as well as specific (idiosyncratic) risks. The direct management of systematic risks helps to mitigate exposure to unwanted or uncompensated risks.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Systematic Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all alpha factors, the risk model includes approximately 15 different stand-alone risk measures to determine how each stock's return is affected by common themes. There are three primary categories for these systematic risks: Market, Risk Premia, and ESG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market  risks  include  indicators  such  as  Beta  (the  sensitivity  of  stocks,  industries,  and  factors  to  market movements), Volatility (the risk associated with exposure to high and low volatility stocks, which is particularly important during market turning points), and Size (market value of a stock).  The management of market risks is critical because these factors are most affected by exogenous shocks such as central bank policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Premia include indicators that capture systematic risks because they are widely followed by investors (e.g., 'smart  beta'  or  crowded  factors)  and/or  cyclical  performance.  Examples  of  Risk  Premia  include  the  welldocumented construction of 12-month price momentum, P/E multiples, and profitability. While these indicators are  expected  to  carry  a  small  level  of  compensation,  the  Q  team's  process  incorporates  them  primarily  as systematic risks to manage in portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "ESG risks assess the environmental, social, and governance characteristics of each company. The proliferation of  ESG  aware  strategies  over  the  past  several  years  has  contributed  to  ESG  factors  becoming  increasingly important systematic risks going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific  risks  capture  company  specific  characteristics  (such  as  ratios  gauging  the  strength  of  a  company's balance sheet) as well as the expected volatility for individual stocks, industries, sectors, and countries that are not already explained by systematic factors in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Transaction Cost Forecasts\n",
      "\n",
      "The  team's  daily  portfolio  rebalancing  process  directly  incorporates  transaction  costs  into  the  assessment  of potential trades by estimating both explicit (e.g., commissions, custodial fees) and implicit (e.g., market impact) trading costs. The model also recognizes the non-linear relationship between transaction cost and trade size and has  the  capacity  to  dynamically  model  potential  opportunities  that  are  presented  through  unexpected  market liquidity. Importantly, the model considers the multi-day impact of trades on stock prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Portfolio Construction\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock  positions  are  determined  using  a  proprietary  multi-strategy  optimization  framework,  which  dynamically evaluates opportunities across all stocks within the investment universe every day. Each portfolio is optimized relative to its specific benchmark with the purpose of maximizing expected return and satisfying the client's risk constraints  while taking  transaction costs  into account. An important objective in  the  Q team's approach is to minimize all unrewarded systematic biases and this is accomplished through a combination of risk penalties in the objective function as well as constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "A systematic process is most effective with sufficient  breadth, and therefore diversification of active positions across many securities and sectors is a key characteristic of the portfolios; the quantitative portfolios typically have many more holdings than a fundamental process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  portfolio  construction  process  provides  the  flexibility  to  tailor  investment  solutions  to  meet  client-specific objectives and risk constraints. Portfolios range from traditional long-only portfolios with a range of benchmarks to extension and market neutral strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "- Market impact of trades\n",
      "\n",
      "The core algorithm used in the Q team's portfolio construction process is mean-variance optimization and the optimization  kernel  is  provided  by  a  third-party.  Asides  from  the  core  optimization  kernel,  everything  in  the portfolio construction process was developed in-house including the features described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  team  has  developed  multi-portfolio  capabilities  in  its  optimization  algorithm.  This  ensures  that  each portfolio's trades are optimized with an accurate estimate of the combined transaction costs that will be incurred to trade each security across all portfolios. This also ensures a fair allocation of liquidity to each portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The return  and  risk  forecasts  used in  the  optimization  have  a  horizon  of one year.  The  team has  developed multi-period awareness into the optimization algorithm so that the trade-off between return and transaction costs is  dependent  on  the  expected  path  of  realization  of  each  stock's  return  forecast.  This  allows  the  Q  team  to combine signals with widely varying horizons in its model and optimally trade to capture the alpha from those signals in the portfolio construction process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team's proprietary transaction cost model provides estimates of the market impact associated with buying or selling a stock based on how many shares will be traded and the stock's liquidity and other characteristics. This is an input into the optimization and is used in the objective function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portfolio construction process outputs a daily list of trades, which is reviewed and signed off by the portfolio managers before being handed over to the trading team to execute in the markets throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Market Implementation / Trading\n",
      "\n",
      "Trading  is  a  key  component  in  achieving  added  value  objectives.  Throughout  the  trading  process,  the  team seeks to minimize the overall cost of trading, including among other items, commissions and market impact, as well  the  opportunity  cost  of  unexecuted  trades.  To  achieve  this  objective,  trading  strategy  research  is  an important area of focus for the trading team. The traders work in collaboration with the research analysts and portfolio  managers  to  develop  and  continuously  enhance  a  comprehensive  trading  strategy  framework.  This framework identifies the optimal trading strategy for each order each day based on specific characteristics of the order  and  the  market  structure  of  the  region  in  which  each  stock  trades.  Resources  on  the  team  are  also dedicated to continuously improving market access (countries, trading venues, instrument types, etc.) with the objective of maximizing the team's ability to reflect model insights in the portfolios managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon signoff of the daily trade list by the portfolio managers, trades are executed in the market in accordance with  the  optimal  strategy  identified  through  the  Q  team's  framework.  Trades may  be  executed  through  direct market access, algorithms, broker program desks, and broker block desks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "During  the  trading  day,  implementation  of  the  optimization  process  is  tracked  and  validated  by  the  portfolio managers. Portfolios  are  continuously monitored  and  reviewed  to  ensure  that  performance  is  consistent  with expectations given market conditions and the portfolio's exposures remain within the targeted boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well, evaluation of performance attribution is a key part of the investment process, both to understand what is driving current performance and to generate ideas for enhancements to the strategy. This work is done both on live portfolios as well as long dated back-tests of simulated portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through this work, the Q team examines attribution at the country, sector, industry, and stock levels as well as factor-based  attribution.  Factor-based  attribution  enables  the  team  to  compare  how  actual  returns  (ex-post) compare to forecast returns (ex-ante) for different segments of the model (alpha, risk, and transaction cost). It also  enables  the  team  to  analyze  residual  elements  of  performance  that  are  not  directly  explained  by  the investment  model.  Through  this  analysis,  the  team  identifies  any  systematic  differences  between  actual  and forecast performance.\n",

      "\n",
      "These inefficiencies result  from  investors not fully exploiting, on  a timely basis, information that is  relevant  to stock prices due to limited attention and information processing capacity.

These  systematic  errors  include overreaction,  herding  and  avoiding  regret.  It  also  exploits  informational  errors  that  are  available  because investors  are  slow  to  act  on  information  that  is  relevant  for  security  pricing.  To  take  advantage  of  both behavioural  and  informational  mispricing  of  stocks,  the  Q  team  identifies  and  uses  a  broad  set  of  predictive factors that are based on familiar investment concepts such as value and momentum as well as characteristics relevant for identifying opportunities in which prices do not reflect the longer-term fundamentals of companies.\n",

      "The Q team derives its edge in exploiting these inefficiencies by combining intuitively sound investment concepts with the disciplines and risk management of a quantitative investment process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Q  team's  approach  offers  an  edge  relative  to  fundamental  investment  managers  by  simultaneously combining several investment disciplines in a risk/reward setting.  Unlike managers who use only bottom-up or top-down  information  or  are  biased  towards  value  or  growth,  the  Q  team's  core  process  simultaneously evaluates a diverse set of predictive factors (e.g. value, accruals and momentum) across multiple dimensions (e.g. industries and individual stocks) for every stock in the investment universe.  By doing so, the team is able to  be  more  objective  in  its  decision-making.  This  approach  enables  the  Q  team  to  improve  the  accuracy  of forecasts  and  uncover  more opportunities.  Furthermore, the  process explicitly trades off  forecast  returns  and risk in the context of transaction costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team's edge relative  to  other  quantitative  managers  also  stems  from  its  ability  to  process  information across multiple dimensions and breadth of data to improve forecasts.  In addition, the philosophy of exploiting the underlying causes of market inefficiencies rather than the inefficiencies themselves results in a process that is  more  robust.  It  recognizes  that  the  precise  nature  of  inefficiencies  will  evolve  over  time,  however,  their underlying causes are based on human behavior and, as such, are persistent and can provide regular sources for adding value in the future.  The Q team avoids the use of factors that might exhibit historical significance but whose  predictive  power  cannot  be  explained  by  sound  investment  principles,  strong  logic  and  systematic investor behaviour.\n",

This enables the portfolio to  balance currency risk with the transaction costs associated with hedging the exposure; the portfolio will not incur unnecessary costs where the relative benefit is deemed small. Currency risk is a very small contributor to total portfolio risk.\n",

      "## 4.16.5 How are individual position weights determined?\n",
      "\n",
      "As  discussed  above,  stock  positions  are  determined  using  a  proprietary  multi-strategy  optimization framework, which dynamically evaluates opportunities across all stocks within the investment universe every day. Each portfolio is optimized relative to its specific benchmark with the purpose of maximizing expected return and satisfying the client's risk constraints while taking transaction costs into account. An important objective in the team's approach is to minimize all unrewarded systematic biases and this is accomplished through a combination of risk penalties in the objective function as well as constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to systematic exposures within a portfolio, capital allocation to each of the different return indicators is entirely objective and determined by a combination of how well each indicator is expected to predict  price  performance  as  well  as  the  risk  and  cost  associated  with  the  indicator.  Indicators  with greater ability to forecast returns per unit of risk and associated transaction cost generally have a greater weight in the portfolio. In addition, the level of investment opportunity (i.e., significance of the forecast) varies dynamically for several of the return factors based on the market environment and stock-specific characteristics. This influences the effective weight of these factors in the model at any given time.\n",

During the call, CC&amp;L discussed the company's approach to third-party verification of their reported GHG emissions, and whether their emissions were verified using audit standards.

The company was receptive to feedback, and was open to  providing  auditor  assurance  in  reporting  in  the  future.

This  assurance  covers  100%  of  the  company's  reported  GHG emissions.  The  company's  scope  3  emissions  include  the  emissions  associated  with  their  products  sold (category 11 in the GHG protocol), which they consider to be the most material category to the company. Based on CC&amp;L's review, CNQ has taken reasonable steps to address the concerns CC&amp;L raised in 2022, and at this stage,  CC&amp;L  determined  that  no  further  escalation  regarding  CNQ's  climate  accounting  and  audit  work  was necessary at this time.\n",

      "Performance history for the CC&amp;L Q Global Equity Strategy is that of the CC&amp;L Q Global Equity Composite. The composite has an inception  date  of  January  1,  2002.  All  returns  are  gross  of  fees.  Performance  returns  are  stated  in  USD  and  are  a  straight conversion  of  the  Canadian  dollars  (CAD)  composite,  which  is  the  base  currency  of  the  Composite.  They  are  converted  by calculating performance for the underlying portfolios contained in the composite in USD on a daily frequency using applicable FX rates. Composite performance in USD is then calculated on a monthly frequency by asset weighting the monthly USD performance of  the  individual  constituent  portfolios  by  their  beginning  of  month  market  values.  Past  performance  is  not  a  guide  to  futue performance. The value of an investment and income from it can go down as well as up. Your capital is at risk. Returns could be reduced, or losses incurred, due to currency fluctuations. For a complete disclaimer regarding investment performance calculations, please see footnotes at the end of the GIPS Presentation.\n",

      "In  addition  to  the  above,  the  team  is  mindful  that  their  investment  model  does  not  always  fully  capture  the prevailing market and economic conditions. There are circumstances, for example, in which the primary driver influencing company stock prices lies outside of what is captured by the team's indicators, resulting in a situation in which the strategy and model may not perform as expected. There are also circumstances in which risks to capital  preservation  emerge.  For  these  reasons,  a  disciplined  and  effective  approach  to  the  oversight  of  the team's  investment  strategy  and  portfolios  is  a  key  part  of  the  value  their  portfolio  managers  bring.    The  key objective of this oversight is for the PM team to ensure the team's models are being used as intended and under circumstances  considered  in  the  model  construction.  There  are  situations  in  which  the  team's  portfolio management  team  will  introduce  risk  management  overlays  into  clients'  portfolios;  however,  the  team  has designed their investment process such that risk management overlays are required infrequently. Most of the time,  the  team's  systematic  risk  management  and  portfolio  construction  process  appropriately  captures  the prevailing market and economic conditions and positions their portfolios optimally without overlays.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5.6 Can you give an example of the portfolio being adjusted as a result of risk management (either to increase or reduce risk)?\n",
      "\n",
      "CC&amp;L's portfolio construction process incorporates a dynamic risk model and will adjust portfolio exposures daily based on changes in return expectations and risk profiles, subject to transaction costs. In addition, CC&amp;L has\n",
      "\n",
      "incorporated  stock  and  sector  risk  limits  into  its  portfolio  monitoring  process.  Should  exposure  to  a  stock  or sector exceed the pre-defined limit, the exposure will be quickly reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, positive results from three COVID-19 vaccine trials led to a significant change in the fundamental backdrop of financial markets.  During these shifting environments, the team's model typically  responds  in  three  stages.  In  the  first  stage,  risk  forecasts  immediately  increase  (i.e.,  the  model recognizes  the  higher  risk  environment)  and  exposures  to  factors  where  risks  have  increased  subsequently decline.  In  the  second  stage,  as  the  market  backdrop  settles,  the  model  dynamically  adapts,  picking  up  on emergent  themes.  In  the  final  stage,  the  portfolio  adjusts  in  response  to  the  new  themes.  Starting  in  early November  and  continuing  through  December,  the  team  observed  the  first  stage  of  this  transition  within  their model, with risk forecasts increasing and a reduction in active exposures, particularly to trend-based measures. The  time  required  for  the  portfolio  to  fully  adjust  varies  with  every  rotation,  and  there  can  be  performance volatility throughout the transition. Once the transition occurs, however, performance typically recovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While rare, the team's  portfolio managers will occasionally introduce portfolio adjustments ('risk management overlays') that are not a result of the daily systematic process. An example of such a risk management overlay occurred  in  late  January  2022.  The  team  along  with  the  firm's  risk  committee  determined  that  the  events unfolding between Russia and Ukraine were significantly impacting the pricing of Russian securities. The first observation  was  that  the  team's  models  were  uncovering  seemingly  'undervalued'  Russian  stocks  and  not recognizing  the  growing  risks  of  a  conflict.  Of  particular  focus  was  an  expectation  of  elevated  liquidity  risks outside of those measured by the model - specifically, an increasing probability of capital controls on Russian securities.  These  concerns  resulted  in  the  team's  decision  to  proactively  withdraw  investments  locally  from Russia,  while  managing  risk  relative  to  benchmarks  through  investments  in  foreign  listings  of  Russian companies (ADRs and GDRs traded in the US and UK markets respectively). As tensions continued to escalate into  February  2022,  the  team  concluded  that  capital  invested  in  the  securities  of  all  Russian  companies (regardless of where they were traded) was at risk. As a result, the team made the decision to limit the positions in  all  Russian  ADRs/GDRs to benchmark weight or less.  By  the  time  Russia  invaded  Ukraine  and  trading  in Russian companies was effectively halted, the team had largely removed Russian exposure from their global strategies.\n",

Areas of focus for  this  project  included  our  approach  to  ESG  integration,  proxy  voting,  engagement,  communication,  and climate change.

As well, CC&amp;L recognizes that there is overlap across mandates; the assets in any one strategy may affect capacity availability for its other strategies. For example, emerging market mandates infringe on capacity of other foreign mandates; the same can be said for  small  cap  mandates  relative  to  large  cap  mandates.

The ESG Committee is required to meet at least  quarterly,  however,  meetings  and  discussions  are  more  frequent  in  practice.  The  composition  of  the Committee was purposefully created in order to facilitate the flow of information between the Committee and the investment teams as well as to foster dialogue across investment teams.  The CC&amp;L ESG Committee reports directly to the Board and its mandate is to oversee and coordinate firm wide RI activities including:\n",
      "\n",
      "-  Integration of ESG factors in investment processes,\n",
      "-  Education of the firm's teams including the internal communication of industry best practices and gathering of team insights regarding RI,\n",
      "-  External communication efforts including reporting to CC&amp;L's clients on RI issues,\n",
      "-  Stewardship and engagement practices, including proxy voting,\n",
      "-  ESG related policies and guidelines, including proxy voting and stewardship and engagement policy,\n",
      "-  Oversight of commitments under industry collaborative initiatives, including as a signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI),\n",

      "In general, there is wide acceptance within our organization of ESG principles. That said, the ESG Committee discusses trends and best practices, brings in external speakers, and promotes idea generation amongst each of CC&amp;L's investment teams. The CC&amp;L ESG Committee reports directly to the Board. Objectives and priorities for each  calendar  year  are  set  out  and  the  ESG  Committee  members,  particularly  the  Chair,  have  performance objectives that are tied to these goals. In addition, the S&amp;E team's incentive pay is tied to the achievement of ESG objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  addition  to  this,  the  key  investment  professionals  are  owners  of  the  firm  and  not  directly  rewarded  for performance or revenues. The majority of their compensation is via equity ownership and the long-term success of the business. This aligns individual financial rewards with CC&amp;L's clients' long-term goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3  Section Three: Compensation\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1 Describe in detail the compensation structure for your firm's portfolio managers, research analysts, and traders,  including  incentives,  bonuses,  performance-based  compensation,  equity  ownership,  and  the portion of total compensation represented by incentives. Please note if the bonus (or part of it) vests over a certain period and how it is invested during this vesting period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key investment professionals are business owners in the firm and not directly rewarded for performance or revenues.  The majority  of  their  compensation  is  via  equity  ownership  and  the  success  of  the  business.  This aligns individual financial rewards with CC&amp;L's clients' long-term goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "CC&amp;L's compensation structure is specifically designed to attract, motivate and retain talented professionals. All senior  professionals  receive  a  base  salary  and  participate  directly  in  the  success  of  the  firm  through  equity ownership, the magnitude of which is tied to each individual's contribution to the overall success of the business. As responsibility and contribution are increased over time, ownership is also increased. Investment professionals who  are  not  yet  equity  owners  receive  competitive  salaries  and  bonuses.  In  2011,  CC&amp;L  created  a  new compensation program, 'Principal Program', which is intended to provide another layer of investment personnel (non-partners) with many of the same incentive and retention dynamics created through the ownership structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buy-in and earn-out of ownership interests takes place over an extended period of time and individuals are not required to put up cash to buy equity. The equity that is earned represents non-cash compensation for each individual and is earned over a period of nine years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon retirement, the value of their ownership interest is paid out over nine years. This provides a clear incentive for  the  retiree  to  ensure  that  succession  arrangements  are  in  place  to  promote  the  ongoing  health  of  the organization and to ensure that the organization can successfully achieve client objectives going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm offers competitive  benefits packages and a flexible, team-oriented  work environment. This creates a collegial atmosphere that employees appreciate and reward with their loyalty. In addition, the fact that the firm is employee-owned, and that all investment professionals may be eligible for ownership, is a substantial incentive for employees to remain with the firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "CC&amp;L  believes  this  compensation  structure  is  a  key  competitive  advantage  that  allows  CC&amp;L  to  attract  top investment  professionals,  focuses  employees  on  meeting  long-term  client  objectives  and  ensures  personnel retention and continuity in its investment teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.2 If equity is a component of the compensation structure, is it gifted, or must individuals purchase said equity from the firm, or other entity? Please provide as much detail as possible (e.g., terms, valuation at which equity is purchased, from which entity is equity for new owners, or additional equity for existing owners sourced, vesting schedule if any).\n",

      "Please refer to the response provided in question #3.1 above. In addition, for individuals the buy-in/earn-out of ownership  interests  take  place  over  an  extended  period  of  time  and  reflects  the  increasing/decreasing contribution that is being made by that individual to the overall organization.  As a reminder, individuals are not required  to  put  up  cash  to  purchase  equity.  Equity  ownership  is  'earned  in'  through  a  sharing  of  cash  flows between the buyer and the seller over a period of 9 years. This mechanism provides a clear incentive for the selling  individual  to  ensure  that  succession  arrangements  are  in  place  to  promote  the  ongoing  health  of  the organization and to ensure that the organization can successfully achieve client objectives going forward.\n",

      "The key personnel in the firm are partners in the Connor, Clark &amp; Lunn Investment Management Partnership which is the sole shareholder of CC&amp;L. There is a non-compete clause in the partnership agreement. The clause explicitly  restricts  partners from  carrying on or becoming engaged in or connected with any trade or business which  is  in  competition  with  the  business  of  CC&amp;L.

These  investments  are  either  part  of  the  GRS  plans  that  are  invested  in  CC&amp;L strategies, or taxable investment savings.  There is not a policy that requires investment, nor does CC&amp;L insist on investment, however, CC&amp;L facilitates this with a discounted fee and a resource within its private client group that  looks  after  the  needs  of  employees.  CC&amp;L  does  not  provide  percentage  of  personal  assets  in  the strategies, as this is confidential, however CC&amp;L does report that there is in excess of $100 million dollars of employee funding in CC&amp;L strategies.\n",

Investment teams have  grown  steadily  with  the  addition  of  seasoned  industry  professionals,  blended  with  recent  university graduates who bring to CC&amp;L well-developed analytical skills. Each year, ownership is reviewed and deserving individuals are given the opportunity to gradually increase their ownership as their contribution to the business grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Succession  plans  have  been  very  well  executed.  Current  team  leaders  are  all  from  the  second  and  third generation of business owners and their economic interest in the business is greater than that of the founding generation. The firm is also enjoying significant contribution from the third and fourth generation of key decision makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment professionals at CC&amp;L work in integrated team environments using highly structured investment processes.  As  a  result,  the  departure  of  any  individual  team  member  would  have  little  material  impact  on investment strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example of CC&amp;L's approach to managing succession, in January 2013, Martin Gerber, who was Head of the Quantitative Equity Team succeeded Larry Lunn as President of the firm. Larry stayed on with the firm as Chairman and as a member of the Asset Allocation Team until his retirement in March of 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "As another example, in the spring of 2014, CC&amp;L announced that Steven Huang, a senior portfolio manager who managed research on the Quantitative Equity Team (Q team), would become Head of the Q team in 2016. The transition from Martin Gerber to Steven progressed as planned, with Steven taking on additional leadership and operational  responsibilities.  Steven  Huang  was  promoted  to  Director  in  2014.  Leadership  was  officially transferred to Steven in January 2016. This change created opportunities for others on the team to step forward and assume additional responsibilities which has helped to broaden the leadership within this growing team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, with the growth of the team to investment professionals, CC&amp;L completed a review of the team structure in 2021 and identified a need for additional leadership resources as the scope and complexity of this part of the firm's business has grown.\n",

      "CC&amp;L concluded that the team would benefit from a co-leadership structure where Jennifer Drake, a Director at CC&amp;L and portfolio manager on the Quantitative Equity team would take on a co-head role alongside Steven Huang.

      "## Investment Philosophy and Process\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.6 Describe your investment philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the Q team's investment philosophy is that equity prices are set by the growth, valuation and quality fundamentals of their companies over the long term. However, the market process by which prices accurately reflect these fundamentals is not perfect with a number of behavioral, informational and structural hurdles and frictions that can prevent stock prices from efficiently reflecting these fundamentals. This results in mis-pricings in the marketplace that offer opportunities to add value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustainable and differentiated alpha can be generated by focusing on the evaluation of both fundamentals as well  as  opportunities  created by mis-pricings. While  the importance  of fundamentals as well as the impact of market inefficiencies is widely understood and accepted by the industry and academic literature, the Q team has developed  a  unique  model  that  applies  a  rigorous  and  systematic  approach  to  measuring  not  only  the fundamentals  of  businesses,  but  also  inefficiencies  that  result  in  temporary  stock  price  dislocations  and  the creation of investment opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team's success as a systematic manager is equally dependent on having sound investment intuition and leading-edge  technologies  for  analysis  and  computation.  Because  of  this,  both  technology  and  investment professionals work side-by-side in a fully collaborative team environment. The Q team's technology leaders are equal partners at the table for strategic decision-making and the dedicated technology professionals sit directly alongside the research and PM teams in designing and building CC&amp;L's investment processes.\n",

      "## General Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Q  team's  investment  approach  is  structured  around  a  systematic  forecast  model  that  quantitatively assesses  opportunities  in  stocks  based  on  the  team's  investment  philosophy  and  uses  these  forecasts  in  a disciplined  and  risk  managed  portfolio  management  process.  The  model  is  primarily  structural  in  nature  and factor based.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment universe comprises approximately 18,000 securities, 160 industry groups and 50 developed and emerging countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below  is  a  description  of  each  of  the  three  primary  components  of  the  daily  investment  process:  1)  Return Forecasts, 2) Risk Assessments, and 3) Transaction Cost Forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Return Forecasts\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Q  team's  return  forecast  model  analyzes  key  market  drivers  that  the  team  understands  to  drive  stock, industry,  and  country  returns.  For  each  security,  a  12-month  return  forecast  is  generated  by  each  individual indicator.  The  return  forecast  model  includes  over  70  indicators  which  are  designed  to  be  additive.  Similar indicators are aggregated into factor groups, which are the inputs into the team's return forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting  on  the  philosophy,  that  sustainable  and  differentiated  alpha  can  be  generated  by  focusing  on  the evaluation of both fundamentals as well as opportunities created by mis-pricings, the team has established two broad categories of indicators within its return forecast framework: Fundamentals and Opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Return Analysis Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image8 -->\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fundamentals\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental  drivers  include  the  Q  team's  proprietary  indicators  that  capture  the  fundamental  attributes  of growth,  valuation,  and  quality  of  companies.  These  indicators  are  derived  from  both  market  data  as  well  as information  from  financial  statements  and  analyst  reports.  Importantly,  these  attributes  are  measured  using global data sets and comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "The model gauges the growth outlook for each stock by evaluating various indicators of growth potential for the company, including the expected impact of industry and country trends. These indicators are short to medium term in nature and measure the trends in reported data as well as forecasted expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indicator Example: Industry Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicator assesses relative growth by measuring global trends in industries. The Q team measures these trends  at  seven  levels  of  industry  aggregation  ranging  from  the  top  level,  consisting  of  11  broadly  defined industries, to the most detailed seventh level that includes over 1,400 different industries. The team controls for systematic tilts within an industry, such as capitalization or volatility, in the team's estimation of trends. The Q team constructs estimates of how each of these global trends influence the growth path of each stock based on their exposure and sensitivity to each industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional  examples  of  growth  indicators  include  stock  specific  and  country  trends,  fundamental  growth,  and market sentiment themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Value\n",
      "\n",
      "An assessment is made to determine if a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its peers. More specifically, the Q team's value indicators evaluate projections of a company's profits in relation to the current market value. This analysis encompasses several different indicators of value with a balance between cash flow and asset-based indicators. For stock-level valuations, shared influences such  as industry and  regional effects are removed to enable companies to be more appropriately compared to their peers. Finally, the model dynamically considers the breadth (or spread) of relative valuations and adjusts forecasts accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indicator Example: Earnings Yield\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicator compares the market value of a company to the ability of the company to generate earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Value characteristics are evaluated at a stock, industry, and country level.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality measures how efficiently a company uses its capital as well as how aggressive or conservative it is in reporting its financial results. These indicators gauge the quality or sustainability of the underlying business.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indicator Example: Capital Efficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "This  indicator  captures  the  tendency  for  companies  to  invest  in  the  best  projects  first  and  to  degrade  their profitability  as  they  make  further  investments  in  lesser  projects.  It  favors  companies  that  are  frugal  with  their capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "As a group, the Q team's proprietary Opportunity indicators (collectively, Opportunity Framework) recognize that while  all  business  are  affected  by  the  economic  and  market  environment  and  while  fundamental  analysis  is equally important for all stocks, the efficiency with which stocks incorporate this fundamental information varies considerably  across  the  market,  given  the  unique  characteristics  of  each  company  and  its  stock.  These inefficiencies  result  from  investors  not  fully  exploiting,  on  a  timely  basis,  information  that  is  relevant  to  stock prices due to limited attention and information processing capacity. Regulatory and market frictions also create structural  opportunities by creating hurdles or impediments to efficient price discovery by market participants. The team's Opportunity Framework is central to its ability to objectively and systematically measure how each individual  security  is  priced  in  the  market  and  as  a  result  what  fundamental  information  has  not  yet  been reflected in the share price by quantifying key stock and market specific metrics that are highly related to these opportunities (e.g., investor attention or 'efficiency').\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussed  in  more  detail  below,  there  are  three  primary  factor  groups  within  the  Opportunity  Framework: Efficiency, Complexity, and Structural.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Efficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "Efficiency indicators identify the varying level of attention investors pay to different companies and the impact this attention has on the significance and rate with which the future prices of companies are expected to respond to  new  information.  These  indicators  systematically  assess  the  'efficiency'  with  which  relevant  fundamental information is incorporated into the share price of each company in the Q team's investment universe. Stocks that are below average in efficiency generally take longer to respond to new fundamental information and as a result, offer more attractive alpha opportunities (and vice versa for stocks with above average efficiency).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "Above  is  discussed  how  Efficiency  measures  focus  on  attention  paid  to  different  companies.  The  team's Complexity indicators take the same concept but shift the focus from attention paid to companies, to attention paid to  data. These indicators capture the challenges investors face  with identifying, obtaining, or processing fundamental data that is relevant to the price of a security. These challenges include impediments in accessing data,  difficulties  processing  certain  types  of  data,  non-linear  relationships  in  data,  as  well  as  complex,  multivariate relationships within datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structural\n",
      "\n",
      "Structural indicators capture  technical impediments that limit the ability  for investors  to reflect their insights  in stock  prices.  These  impediments  exist  due  to  market  limitations  or  regulatory  frictions  and  are  conceptually related to the ability to transact in a security (market access), transaction cost, borrow cost, investor type, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Assessments\n",
      "\n",
      "A disciplined risk management process is critical in the Q team's endeavor to deliver consistent excess returns for its clients. The risk management framework ensures that the team takes investment risk only when warranted by an attractive investment return, and otherwise seeks to minimize uncompensated risk exposure in portfolios. Within the process, risk management involves not only the monitoring of portfolio holdings but, more importantly, the direct integration of risk assessments into portfolio construction, ensuring that portfolio risk is calibrated to operate within mandate constraints in the context of the prevailing capital market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, the Q team has developed a proprietary risk model instead of relying on a third-party risk model. A proprietary risk model is important because, recognizing there is 'no free lunch,' it allows the team to develop risk  factors  that  fully  capture  the  risks  associated  with  its  proprietary  alpha  forecasts,  which  would  not  be measured well by an external model. As a result, the Q team can maintain a more optimal assessment of true\n",
      "\n",
      "portfolio risk. In addition, as the return forecast model is enhanced, the risk model can be calibrated and updated to reflect the changes at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  addition  to  measuring alpha-related risks, the risk model also  assesses known  systematic risks as well as specific (idiosyncratic) risks. The direct management of systematic risks helps to mitigate exposure to unwanted or uncompensated risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Analysis Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image9 -->\n",
      "\n",
      "## Systematic Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all alpha factors, the risk model includes approximately 15 different stand-alone risk measures to determine how each stock's return is affected by common themes. There are three primary categories for these systematic risks: Market, Risk Premia, and ESG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market  risks  include  indicators  such  as  Beta  (the  sensitivity  of  stocks,  industries,  and  factors  to  market movements), Volatility (the risk associated with exposure to high and low volatility stocks, which is particularly important during market turning points), and Size (market value of a stock).  The management of market risks is critical because these factors are most affected by exogenous shocks such as central bank policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Premia include indicators that capture systematic risks because they are widely followed by investors (e.g., 'smart  beta'  or  crowded  factors)  and/or  cyclical  performance.  Examples  of  Risk  Premia  include  the  welldocumented construction of 12-month price momentum, P/E multiples, and profitability. While these indicators are  expected  to  carry  a  small  level  of  compensation,  the  Q  team's  process  incorporates  them  primarily  as systematic risks to manage in portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "ESG risks assess the environmental, social, and governance characteristics of each company. The proliferation of  ESG  aware  strategies  over  the  past  several  years  has  contributed  to  ESG  factors  becoming  increasingly important systematic risks going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific  risks  capture  company  specific  characteristics  (such  as  ratios  gauging  the  strength  of  a  company's balance sheet) as well as the expected volatility for individual stocks, industries, sectors, and countries that are not already explained by systematic factors in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Transaction Cost Forecasts\n",
      "\n",
      "The  team's  daily  portfolio  rebalancing  process  directly  incorporates  transaction  costs  into  the  assessment  of potential trades by estimating both explicit (e.g., commissions, custodial fees) and implicit (e.g., market impact) trading costs. The model also recognizes the non-linear relationship between transaction cost and trade size and has  the  capacity  to  dynamically  model  potential  opportunities  that  are  presented  through  unexpected  market liquidity. Importantly, the model considers the multi-day impact of trades on stock prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Portfolio Construction\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock  positions  are  determined  using  a  proprietary  multi-strategy  optimization  framework,  which  dynamically evaluates opportunities across all stocks within the investment universe every day. Each portfolio is optimized relative to its specific benchmark with the purpose of maximizing expected return and satisfying the client's risk constraints  while taking  transaction costs  into account. An important objective in  the  Q team's approach is to minimize all unrewarded systematic biases and this is accomplished through a combination of risk penalties in the objective function as well as constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "A systematic process is most effective with sufficient  breadth, and therefore diversification of active positions across many securities and sectors is a key characteristic of the portfolios; the quantitative portfolios typically have many more holdings than a fundamental process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  portfolio  construction  process  provides  the  flexibility  to  tailor  investment  solutions  to  meet  client-specific objectives and risk constraints. Portfolios range from traditional long-only portfolios with a range of benchmarks to extension and market neutral strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image10 -->\n",
      "\n",
      "- Market impact of trades\n",
      "\n",
      "The core algorithm used in the Q team's portfolio construction process is mean-variance optimization and the optimization  kernel  is  provided  by  a  third-party.  Asides  from  the  core  optimization  kernel,  everything  in  the portfolio construction process was developed in-house including the features described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  team  has  developed  multi-portfolio  capabilities  in  its  optimization  algorithm.  This  ensures  that  each portfolio's trades are optimized with an accurate estimate of the combined transaction costs that will be incurred to trade each security across all portfolios. This also ensures a fair allocation of liquidity to each portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The return  and  risk  forecasts  used in  the  optimization  have  a  horizon  of one year.  The  team has  developed multi-period awareness into the optimization algorithm so that the trade-off between return and transaction costs is  dependent  on  the  expected  path  of  realization  of  each  stock's  return  forecast.  This  allows  the  Q  team  to combine signals with widely varying horizons in its model and optimally trade to capture the alpha from those signals in the portfolio construction process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team's proprietary transaction cost model provides estimates of the market impact associated with buying or selling a stock based on how many shares will be traded and the stock's liquidity and other characteristics. This is an input into the optimization and is used in the objective function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portfolio construction process outputs a daily list of trades, which is reviewed and signed off by the portfolio managers before being handed over to the trading team to execute in the markets throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Market Implementation / Trading\n",
      "\n",
      "Trading  is  a  key  component  in  achieving  added  value  objectives.  Throughout  the  trading  process,  the  team seeks to minimize the overall cost of trading, including among other items, commissions and market impact, as well  the  opportunity  cost  of  unexecuted  trades.  To  achieve  this  objective,  trading  strategy  research  is  an important area of focus for the trading team. The traders work in collaboration with the research analysts and portfolio  managers  to  develop  and  continuously  enhance  a  comprehensive  trading  strategy  framework.  This framework identifies the optimal trading strategy for each order each day based on specific characteristics of the order  and  the  market  structure  of  the  region  in  which  each  stock  trades.  Resources  on  the  team  are  also dedicated to continuously improving market access (countries, trading venues, instrument types, etc.) with the objective of maximizing the team's ability to reflect model insights in the portfolios managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon signoff of the daily trade list by the portfolio managers, trades are executed in the market in accordance with  the  optimal  strategy  identified  through  the  Q  team's  framework.  Trades may  be  executed  through  direct market access, algorithms, broker program desks, and broker block desks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "During  the  trading  day,  implementation  of  the  optimization  process  is  tracked  and  validated  by  the  portfolio managers. Portfolios  are  continuously monitored  and  reviewed  to  ensure  that  performance  is  consistent  with expectations given market conditions and the portfolio's exposures remain within the targeted boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well, evaluation of performance attribution is a key part of the investment process, both to understand what is driving current performance and to generate ideas for enhancements to the strategy. This work is done both on live portfolios as well as long dated back-tests of simulated portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through this work, the Q team examines attribution at the country, sector, industry, and stock levels as well as factor-based  attribution.  Factor-based  attribution  enables  the  team  to  compare  how  actual  returns  (ex-post) compare to forecast returns (ex-ante) for different segments of the model (alpha, risk, and transaction cost). It also  enables  the  team  to  analyze  residual  elements  of  performance  that  are  not  directly  explained  by  the investment  model.  Through  this  analysis,  the  team  identifies  any  systematic  differences  between  actual  and forecast performance.\n",

      "\n",
      "These inefficiencies result  from  investors not fully exploiting, on  a timely basis, information that is  relevant  to stock prices due to limited attention and information processing capacity.

It  also  exploits  informational  errors  that  are  available  because investors  are  slow  to  act  on  information  that  is  relevant  for  security  pricing.  To  take  advantage  of  both behavioural  and  informational  mispricing  of  stocks,  the  Q  team  identifies  and  uses  a  broad  set  of  predictive factors that are based on familiar investment concepts such as value and momentum as well as characteristics relevant for identifying opportunities in which prices do not reflect the longer-term fundamentals of companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team derives its edge in exploiting these inefficiencies by combining intuitively sound investment concepts with the disciplines and risk management of a quantitative investment process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Q  team's  approach  offers  an  edge  relative  to  fundamental  investment  managers  by  simultaneously combining several investment disciplines in a risk/reward setting.  Unlike managers who use only bottom-up or top-down  information  or  are  biased  towards  value  or  growth,  the  Q  team's  core  process  simultaneously evaluates a diverse set of predictive factors (e.g. value, accruals and momentum) across multiple dimensions (e.g. industries and individual stocks) for every stock in the investment universe.  By doing so, the team is able to  be  more  objective  in  its  decision-making.  This  approach  enables  the  Q  team  to  improve  the  accuracy  of forecasts  and  uncover  more opportunities.  Furthermore, the  process explicitly trades off  forecast  returns  and risk in the context of transaction costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q team's edge relative  to  other  quantitative  managers  also  stems  from  its  ability  to  process  information across multiple dimensions and breadth of data to improve forecasts.  In addition, the philosophy of exploiting the underlying causes of market inefficiencies rather than the inefficiencies themselves results in a process that is  more  robust.  It  recognizes  that  the  precise  nature  of  inefficiencies  will  evolve  over  time,  however,  their underlying causes are based on human behavior and, as such, are persistent and can provide regular sources for adding value in the future.  The Q team avoids the use of factors that might exhibit historical significance but whose  predictive  power  cannot  be  explained  by  sound  investment  principles,  strong  logic  and  systematic investor behaviour.\n",

      "## 4.15 In which markets do you believe your strategy performs best/worst? (Provide examples of time periods).\n",

To this end, the investment process was designed and tested to work as consistently as possible in a wide variety of economic and market conditions. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify periods that will typically be characterized by unusually positive or negative performance.\n",

      "Positive Relative Performance: The process has proven to perform during most periods. This is true for example, whether market leadership has been driven by a particular growth or value style, or whether the environment has favored  particular  market  capitalization  or  industry  segments.  Strong  performance  typically  coincides  with periods when the market environment is fairly persistent; e.g., 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negative Relative Performance: The process has not worked as well during periods of rapidly changing market leadership or dramatic directional changes. These conditions are generally present in the very early stages of market  recoveries  following  bear  markets  or  at  market  peaks  or  transition  periods  in  market  leadership  (i.e., second half of 2018).

      "## 4.16.2 What types of securities are considered for purchase?\n",

      "## 4.16.3 Please include details of the derivatives used and policies surrounding the use of derivatives. What type of risk measures are taken specifically with regard to derivatives exposure and usage?\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivative  instruments  will  only  be  used  in  ways  that  are  consistent  with  the  strategy's  investment objectives. The underlying exposures facilitated through the use of derivatives will be incorporated into the strategy's constraints. Counterparty risk arising from derivative transactions will be limited to credits rated \"A-\" or better. Instruments used may include but are not limited to futures, forwards, options, swaps and structured notes. Derivatives cannot be used to facilitate or effect the borrowing of money.\n",

      "\n",
      "Forward  contracts  are  used  to  implement  all  hedged  positions,  and  all  hedging  is  based  in  USD. Currency hedging is managed through CC&amp;L's portfolio optimization process. This enables the portfolio to  balance currency risk with the transaction costs associated with hedging the exposure; the portfolio will not incur unnecessary costs where the relative benefit is deemed small. Currency risk is a very small contributor to total portfolio risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.16.5 How are individual position weights determined?\n",
      "\n",
      "As  discussed  above,  stock  positions  are  determined  using  a  proprietary  multi-strategy  optimization framework, which dynamically evaluates opportunities across all stocks within the investment universe every day. Each portfolio is optimized relative to its specific benchmark with the purpose of maximizing expected return and satisfying the client's risk constraints while taking transaction costs into account. An important objective in the team's approach is to minimize all unrewarded systematic biases and this is accomplished through a combination of risk penalties in the objective function as well as constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to systematic exposures within a portfolio, capital allocation to each of the different return indicators is entirely objective and determined by a combination of how well each indicator is expected to predict  price  performance  as  well  as  the  risk  and  cost  associated  with  the  indicator.  Indicators  with greater ability to forecast returns per unit of risk and associated transaction cost generally have a greater weight in the portfolio. In addition, the level of investment opportunity (i.e., significance of the forecast) varies dynamically for several of the return factors based on the market environment and stock-specific characteristics. This influences the effective weight of these factors in the model at any given time.\n",

CC&amp;L's  simulations  include  periods  of  global  conflict  (e.g.,  Persian  Gulf  War),  instability  in  the financial  system,  (e.g.,  Russian  debt  default  of  1997),  market  crash  (e.g.,  October  1987)  and  economic recession  (e.g.,  1991).

      "Performance history for the CC&amp;L Q Global Equity Strategy is that of the CC&amp;L Q Global Equity Composite. The composite has an inception  date  of  January  1,  2002.  All  returns  are  gross  of  fees.  Performance  returns  are  stated  in  USD  and  are  a  straight conversion  of  the  Canadian  dollars  (CAD)  composite,  which  is  the  base  currency  of  the  Composite.  They  are  converted  by calculating performance for the underlying portfolios contained in the composite in USD on a daily frequency using applicable FX rates. Composite performance in USD is then calculated on a monthly frequency by asset weighting the monthly USD performance of  the  individual  constituent  portfolios  by  their  beginning  of  month  market  values.  Past  performance  is  not  a  guide  to  futue performance. The value of an investment and income from it can go down as well as up. Your capital is at risk.

      "In  addition  to  the  above,  the  team  is  mindful  that  their  investment  model  does  not  always  fully  capture  the prevailing market and economic conditions. There are circumstances, for example, in which the primary driver influencing company stock prices lies outside of what is captured by the team's indicators, resulting in a situation in which the strategy and model may not perform as expected. There are also circumstances in which risks to capital  preservation  emerge.  For  these  reasons,  a  disciplined  and  effective  approach  to  the  oversight  of  the team's  investment  strategy  and  portfolios  is  a  key  part  of  the  value  their  portfolio  managers  bring.    The  key objective of this oversight is for the PM team to ensure the team's models are being used as intended and under circumstances  considered  in  the  model  construction.  There  are  situations  in  which  the  team's  portfolio management  team  will  introduce  risk  management  overlays  into  clients'  portfolios;  however,  the  team  has designed their investment process such that risk management overlays are required infrequently. Most of the time,  the  team's  systematic  risk  management  and  portfolio  construction  process  appropriately  captures  the prevailing market and economic conditions and positions their portfolios optimally without overlays.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5.6 Can you give an example of the portfolio being adjusted as a result of risk management (either to increase or reduce risk)?\n",
      "\n",
      "CC&amp;L's portfolio construction process incorporates a dynamic risk model and will adjust portfolio exposures daily based on changes in return expectations and risk profiles, subject to transaction costs. In addition, CC&amp;L has\n",
      "\n",
      "incorporated  stock  and  sector  risk  limits  into  its  portfolio  monitoring  process.  Should  exposure  to  a  stock  or sector exceed the pre-defined limit, the exposure will be quickly reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, positive results from three COVID-19 vaccine trials led to a significant change in the fundamental backdrop of financial markets.  During these shifting environments, the team's model typically  responds  in  three  stages.  In  the  first  stage,  risk  forecasts  immediately  increase  (i.e.,  the  model recognizes  the  higher  risk  environment)  and  exposures  to  factors  where  risks  have  increased  subsequently decline.  In  the  second  stage,  as  the  market  backdrop  settles,  the  model  dynamically  adapts,  picking  up  on emergent  themes.  In  the  final  stage,  the  portfolio  adjusts  in  response  to  the  new  themes.  Starting  in  early November  and  continuing  through  December,  the  team  observed  the  first  stage  of  this  transition  within  their model, with risk forecasts increasing and a reduction in active exposures, particularly to trend-based measures. The  time  required  for  the  portfolio  to  fully  adjust  varies  with  every  rotation,  and  there  can  be  performance volatility throughout the transition. Once the transition occurs, however, performance typically recovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While rare, the team's  portfolio managers will occasionally introduce portfolio adjustments ('risk management overlays') that are not a result of the daily systematic process. An example of such a risk management overlay occurred  in  late  January  2022.  The  team  along  with  the  firm's  risk  committee  determined  that  the  events unfolding between Russia and Ukraine were significantly impacting the pricing of Russian securities. The first observation  was  that  the  team's  models  were  uncovering  seemingly  'undervalued'  Russian  stocks  and  not recognizing  the  growing  risks  of  a  conflict.  Of  particular  focus  was  an  expectation  of  elevated  liquidity  risks outside of those measured by the model - specifically, an increasing probability of capital controls on Russian securities.  These  concerns  resulted  in  the  team's  decision  to  proactively  withdraw  investments  locally  from Russia,  while  managing  risk  relative  to  benchmarks  through  investments  in  foreign  listings  of  Russian companies (ADRs and GDRs traded in the US and UK markets respectively). As tensions continued to escalate into  February  2022,  the  team  concluded  that  capital  invested  in  the  securities  of  all  Russian  companies (regardless of where they were traded) was at risk. As a result, the team made the decision to limit the positions in  all  Russian  ADRs/GDRs to benchmark weight or less.  By  the  time  Russia  invaded  Ukraine  and  trading  in Russian companies was effectively halted, the team had largely removed Russian exposure from their global strategies.\n",
