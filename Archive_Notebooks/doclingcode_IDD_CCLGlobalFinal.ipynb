      "\n",
      "The Antipodes Global Long Strategy's objective is to outperform the MSCI All Country World Net Index in USD over the investment cycle (typically 3-5 years)\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes' investment philosophy is based upon the significant experience of CIO Jacob Mitchell. Over his long career Jacob observed that more traditional, dogmatic value approaches -those generally wedded to low multiple names -can overemphasize mean reversion and result in very episodic alpha generation when 'value' as a factor outperforms. This reinforced a desire to develop a more pragmatic approach, one which targets resilient businesses across the growth spectrum which are priced attractively relative to their growth profile (how Antipodes defines company value), making it more adaptable to different market environments. Antipodes' 'pragmatic value' approach utilizes a contemporary combination of fundamental, bottom -up analysis with an awareness of top-down factors and sophisticated use of quantitative investment tools including:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Considering structural growth and not solely cyclical mean reversion;\n",
      "- Insisting upon 'multiple ways of winning' at the stock level, which helps avoid value traps and seeks to benefit from macro and style headwinds as well as more traditional idiosyncratic stock-level fundamentals; and\n",
      "- Focusing on uncorrelated alpha clusters at the portfolio level, which helps avoid overexposure to certain geographies, sectors and/or macro/style factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing portfolios through the 2007-2008 market turmoil reinforced Jacob's belief in the importance of having truly uncorrelated sources of alpha in a portfolio. During times of market crisis or market volatility, stocks which appear uncorrelated can start moving as one for long periods of time -potentially they share the same end customers or are exposed to the same style or macro risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4.7 Describe your investment style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes defines our investment style as 'Pragmatic value'. This approach acknowledges both structural and cyclical change and defines value investing as paying the right price for growth and business resilience. Antipodes invests across the continuum of low to high growth but always seek to pay an attractive multiple. Antipodes is agnostic as to the level of growth as long as the multiple paid reflects this trade-off. Antipodes believes conventional value is too dependent on cyclical mean reversion frameworks, which when applied in isolation of a structural change framework, may lead to 'value traps'.\n",

      "\n",
      "Antipodes uses a range of sophisticated qualitative and quantitative tools, in addition to team experience to find new ideas and filter the investment universe down from ~5,000 companies. The include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Qualitative inputs/signals: considerations of institutional or corporate environment change, neglected themes i.e., bankruptcy or spin-offs, merger and acquisition activity and market dislocations such as panic selling.\n",
      "- Quantitative filters: stock, sector and geographic level screening for expressions of neglect or consensus and correlation identification\n",
      "\n",
      "Once an idea has formed, this is formalized by way of a short hypothesis paper / test note which is reviewed by the Sector Head and by the CIO. This discussion focuses on three key areas: margin of safety, multiple ways of winning and context within existing portfolio. If the hypothesis note is approved, an analyst will commence an 'Industry Deep Dive' with the belief it is important to understand an entire industry structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Industry Research\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes' broad approach is to lead with fundamental global industry analysis that facilitates proactive individual investment cases when markets become irrational. The industry analysis is a product of Antipodes' long-duration/slow thinking approach, a \"living\" document that is updated as our understanding evolves. Antipodes seeks to anticipate how the industry is likely to evolve and what potential non-linear changes may occur. The industry analysis comprises the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry trends - consider the continuum of industry cyclical, structural and macro trends/change drivers:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Apply sustaining versus disruptive innovation principles to identify both cyclical and structural winners and losers\n",
      "- Apply power laws, non-linear change and fat-tail framework\n",
      "- Antipodes' capital lifecycle phase (with reference to cyclical, structural and socio/macro phase) with reference to appropriate data for evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "Competitive landscape - consider the competitive positioning of each major industry participant (listed and unlisted) including a critical assessment of business resilience, that is, the degree and sustainability of competitive advantage/value drivers:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Competitive dynamics in terms of new entrants, buyers' power, suppliers' power, substitutes and regulatory issues\n",
      "- Market shares in the context of the appropriate market segmentation\n",
      "- Network, scale or other cost advantage\n",
      "- Degree of difficulty to replicate/intangible assets and patents\n",
      "- Nature of customer lock/inertia and level of recurring versus transactional demand\n",
      "- Nature of operational risks, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investment Case\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock-specific investment cases are more time and valuation sensitive. The investment case comprises the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hypothesis versus the tendency of markets to over-react to change\n",
      "- Business resilience/competitive advantage/multiple ways of winning:\n",
      "- Market structure and product cycle dynamics\n",
      "- o Regulation\n",
      "- o Corporate antecedents and management performance\n",
      "- o ESG performance\n",
      "- o Financial analysis\n",
      "- o Style and macro tailwinds/headwinds\n",
      "- Margin of error includes an analysis of the key assumption on which the investment case depends, the range of outcomes around those assumptions, and the risks that require our monitoring as the case evolves.  Consider this a pre-mortem, that is, a consideration of what could go wrong and how would\n",
      "\n",
      "this likely play out. This will assist the sector team buddy and the PM Team to focus on the right issues as part of their overall investment case testing/due diligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Valuation or intrinsic value is an outcome of a two stage discounted cash flow valuation target to capture any period of structural growth, and then calculating the relative market multiple corresponding with the company's current Target Valuation, year 3 underlying EPS, and 3 year forward market multiple. Importantly, this target needs to be justified in the margin of safety discussion.\n",
      "- Contextual margin of safety represents a justification of the DCF derived valuation on a 3yr forward PE (EV/Sales, EV/EBIT, etc. as the case may be) basis versus the market in both a relative sense (and historical relative to relative) and versus industry/style peers. Antipodes' standard comparison table comprehensively covers these data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes' standard model, comparison table and return ranking screens facilitate a debate regarding a company's target valuation in terms of justifying the DCF derived forward multiple (whether it be PE, EV/EBIT, etc.) in both an absolute basis and, importantly, relative to the 3yr forward market (and region/sector) multiple. Antipodes also compares this relative multiple to the historical relative multiple versus the market (and region/sector) as a final sense check. The process of ranking the individual opportunity set and calculating position level excess returns (minimum target of 10%) is a function of our individual company forecasts of earnings growth, dividends and valuation implied re-rating potential versus the aggregate market, i.e. the average of the opportunity set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once developed, the investment case is rigorously debated at a stock meeting to pick apart the idea and understand if it has a role to play in the portfolio. Subject to approval it is available to include within a sector model portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Sector Portfolios\n",
      "\n",
      "These sector portfolios compromise +100 ideas and form the building blocks for construction of the final portfolio. Each sector portfolio has a notional value and is subject to real world constraints such as liquidity. Sector teams express their best investment ideas in a way that frames and informs the investment discussion. The Sector portfolios are also used as a measure of sector team performance, forming a key part of the individual and team remuneration structure. The step-by-step transparent flow from idea generation to sector portfolios and then to the final portfolio ensures that all team members are aware of how their contribution fits into the overall process and final portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Final Portfolio Construction\n",
      "\n",
      "Portfolios are built based on the following principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Optimized to minimize downside volatility with correlated sources of alpha typically limited to less than 15% of the portfolio\n",
      "- For a given level of expected investment risk, position size is determined by expected returns.\n",
      "- Exposure for global strategies:\n",
      "- o Single stock limit at initiation: 7.0% long\n",
      "- o Typically, top 10, 25-35%;\n",
      "\n",
      "- Limit correlations within the portfolio with the aim of minimizing downside volatility\n",
      "- When Antipodes sees a high risk of losing money on an underlying currency exposure, Antipodes may hedge into an appropriately undervalued currency\n",
      "- Where permitted, derivatives may be used to amplify high conviction ideas\n",
      "- In the absence of finding individual investments that do not meet our investment criteria, cash may be held.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk management and stress testing in the context of portfolio construction includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Understanding the markets' factor sensitivity and the likely persistence of these correlations\n",
      "- Monitoring portfolio sensitivity to such factors (are portfolio outcomes luck or skill?)\n",
      "- Predicting regime change and understanding how portfolios are likely to behave based on historical relationships e.g. oil price collapse.\n",
      "- Stress testing results are fed back into Antipodes iterative process and may ultimately trigger changes in research priorities and portfolio construction.\n",

      "Pragmatic Value -Antipodes invests across the spectrum of low to high growth businesses, paying the right price for growth and business resilience. Antipodes delivers an 'all weather' value approach that avoids being hostage to the typical value/growth cycle, and the episodic return profiles of some value managers. Antipodes believes conventional value is too dependent on cyclical mean reversion frameworks, which when applied in isolation of a structural change framework, may lead to 'value traps'.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Process:\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry-led research -Deep industry analysis and longer-term perspective leads to proprietary insights and contrarian investment cases. Antipodes devotes significant time to considering how key industries will look in 510 years and what the potential non-linear changes are. This allows us to anticipate changes in competitive dynamics and product cycles ahead of the market and is critical to establishing a margin of safety at the stock level. Furthermore, Antipodes finds that an industry-led approach is more likely to lead to breakthroughs in establishing contrarian perspectives to the market and often identifies a cluster of ideas at the single stock level that results in an efficient use of research resources. This results in high conviction portfolios without excessive concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Portfolio Construction:\n",
      "\n",
      "Holistic top-down and bottom-up approach -Antipodes integrates quant and macro within a fundamental stock picking framework. Antipodes has a dedicated Quantitative Systems and Macroeconomic team (Quant and Macro team) that is integrated in each stage of the investment process which includes identification, analysis and portfolio construction. This aids capital preservation and improves risk adjusted returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Organizational Design:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sector team/model portfolio approach - the repeatability and success of our investment process is driven by transparency, the right blend between structure and flexibility, and emphasis on the team. For example, the stepby-step transparent flow from idea generation to sector team model portfolios and then to the final portfolio ensures that all team members are aware of how their contribution fits into the overall process and final portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "These differentiators and competitive advantage have seen the Global Long Strategy (Gross of fees) outperform the MSCI ACWI Net Index (USD, net div.) by +0.75% p.a. since inception to 30 June 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further as a value manager, Antipodes is also cognizant of the Strategy's performance relative to the MSCI Value index (MSCI Value) and global value peers. The Strategy has outperformed (USD, gross) MSCI Value Index by +3.4% p.a., and has outperformed many of the Strategy's value peers, demonstrating strong performance against eVestment's All -Cap Value equity peer group which includes over 200 global value managers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cyclical opportunities relate to mean reversion in profitability and valuations around the business cycle, while structural opportunities relate to non-linear/exponential change in situations where most investors expect incremental or cyclical change.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, Antipodes Global Long Strategy's delivered its best absolute performance during 2017 of +31.70% (USD) and +7.72% alpha relative to MSCI ACWI Index (USD). The Strategy was able to generate positive absolute and benchmark relative returns, with a mix of overweight positioning in cyclical sectors, including consumer discretionary (durables &amp; apparel, autos and retailing), utilities and financials, as well as structural opportunities within the information technology sector (particularly hardware).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Long Strategy has underperformed when markets typically decouple from valuation and are willing to pay for 'growth at any price', leading to artificially elevated multiples, i.e. the post -covid period.

      "Antipodes utilizes derivatives, where permitted in the Global Long Strategy. Derivatives cannot be used to gear the portfolio and the underlying effective face value of derivatives (with the exception of Forward FX contracts) is limited to 10% of NAV. Subject to specific investment guidelines, derivatives may be used for the following purposes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Currency hedging (FX forwards)\n",
      "- To achieve long equity exposure via purchase of call options (occasionally used to increase exposure to a certain position in a lower risk manner)\n",

      "\n",
      "Currency is actively managed within the Strategy for risk management purposes, however not hedged back into any underlying currency. Antipodes' starting point is the underlying currency exposure from long equity holdings within the portfolio. Antipodes' Quant and Macro team maintain a relative currency attractiveness model of every currency in the world. This is used to compare to underlying equity exposure, whereby active positioning may take place based on relative attractiveness. The second element of currency positioning is that Antipodes can use it as a macro hedge against long equity exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes recognizes certain clients may undertake currency management internally. Accordingly, clients can elect to remove active currency management from their separate account investment mandate.\n",

      "## 4.16.5 How are individual position weights determined?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each sector team is responsible for sizing the position in their sector team's model portfolio. Sizing is primarily based around risk and how underwritten the business case is -how many and how strong are the multiple ways to win.\n",

      "Yes, where practicable, Antipodes systematically aligns each portfolio to the relevant strategy model portfolio to ensure consistency of performance across portfolios with similar objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our fundamental premise in allocating stock trades across portfolios is to ensure equitable treatment across clients and accounts. Where multiple portfolios are trading on the same day on the same basis for the same security, orders should be aggregated before trading is conducted such that all trade bookings are assigned equally.\n",
      "\n",
      "At close of trading trades will then be allocated on a pro-rata basis (based on initial order size) across all portfolios so that each portfolio achieves the same realised execution price.

Where pro-rata allocation is uneconomical, allocation will be decided by the Antipodes CIO.\n",

In our view, environment, social and governance (ESG) factors may impact a company's operating performance and longer-term outcomes. The market's tendency to irrationally respond to ESG factors can result in both downside risks and upside opportunities and, as an active manager, we seek to generate returns from both situations. Our investment process includes consideration of ESG principles, risks and opportunities in the same framework that we consider all risks and opportunities. We do this for the benefit of our investors, with the hope that we are also contributing to a more stable, sustainable and inclusive global economy.\n",

      "## 6.4. Is your responsible investment policy periodically reviewed?  If so, with what frequency and by whom?\n",

      "\n",
      "There may be instances where Antipodes' interests conflict, or appear to conflict, with client interests. Antipodes' duty is to vote proxies in the best interests of its clients and in accordance with this policy. If an employee of Antipodes detects a material conflict of interest in connection with voting on the resolutions, then the employee should escalate the matter to the CIO and Pinnacle Risk &amp; Compliance to determine the steps to manage the conflict or potential conflict if required. Possible resolutions may include:\n",

      "Antipodes will constructively engage, where relevant, either directly or through the active voting of proxies. Constructive corporate engagement and proxy voting are the fundamental tools of responsible investment.

      "- Antipodes withheld votes to re-elect directors Awo Ablo, Jeffery S Berg, Michael J Boskin, Safra A Catz, Bruce R Chizen, George H Conrades, Lawrence J Ellison, Rona A Fairhead, Jeffrey O Henley, Renee J James, Charles W Moorman, Leon E Panetta, William G Parrett, Naomi O Seligman and Vishal Sikka. A decision to withhold votes is justified for incumbent members of the board (there are no new members proposed for this year) due to multiple consecutive years of insufficient responsiveness to low say-on-pay vote results. This voting decision sends a strong message to the board that shareholder concerns continue to be unaddressed by the compensation committee.\n",
      "- Antipodes also voted against the advisory vote to ratify named executive officer's compensation. This proposal has received less than 70% support for 12 consecutive years. Despite this, there has been no substantive change to the executive pay program to address shareholder concerns. The specific concern is that the annual equity grants to certain NEOs (excluding Catz and Ellison) do not utilise performanceconditioned equity and vest solely over time -a process that is inconsistent with prevailing market practices.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against management's proposal to amend the omnibus stock plan. In our view, a vote against this proposal is justified given the equity program is estimated to be excessively dilutive (assuming maximum dilution, the plan could account for ~20% of shares outstanding). In addition, the plan is excessively costly, has an excessively high three-year average burn rate and allows broad discretion to accelerate vesting.\n",
      "- Finally, Antipodes voted against management and for a shareholder proposal for a report on median and adjusted gender/racial pay gaps. In our view this report would allow shareholders to better evaluate the progress of the company's diversity and inclusive initiatives and management of any related risks.\n",

      "\n",
      "During the first quarter of 2023, we engaged with the company ahead of the reopening of its Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea on both environmental and social issues. Engagement in this instance was first via email with the company Investor Relations and later via video conference with company's Group Sustainability Executive Grant Beringer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Porgera mine operates in a complex social setting in remote PNG and also practices river-based tailings disposals. Porgera mine is one of only three mines left in the world - all of which are in PNG - to still use this tailings method, which results in large amounts of sediment flowing into natural water sources. Consequently, Sustainalytics has placed Barrick on its Global Standards Screening watchlist. Along with the environmental impact of these actions, they have also resulted in reputational impact for the company. We wanted to understand if there a plan of action to reduce the impact of the current tailings disposal system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engagement also included a discussion on the company's plans to implement improved social and environmental programs at the Porgera mine. We noted to the company that over the years, there had been a number of complaints and negative commentary around the use of security forces at Porgera, specifically the interactions between artisanal miners, security forces and the local community. We asked Barrick whether there would be any improvements in the frameworks with respect to security to minimize risks to all parties and for details of those frameworks. We also communicated to Barrick that Antipodes expects to see increased and improved action on community funding in conjunction with a renewed ownership structure in which local stakeholders will own a larger portion of the mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued our engagement with Barrick in the first quarter of 2024 in a conversation with the company's Group Sustainability Executive and Chair of the Compensation Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the meeting we focused on the restart of Barrick's Porgera operations and the company's reintegration with the local community. Barrick pointed to the company's strong relations with the PNG government as being critical in strengthening the relationship with the community and maintaining security against illegal miners where necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation also turned to the proposed Reko Diq site in Pakistan, where we delved into water availability, as well as community relationship programs in the region. Barrick again spoke of the actions it had taken to develop strong government and community relationships to enhance the success of the mine. We took the opportunity to communicate our concerns around the unique community and social factors relevant to the particular region of Reko Diq site.\n",

      "Also during the Q1 24 meeting, we discussed in detail the company's compensation plans. At the 2023 AGM, the company received a 77% approval rate on the say on pay proposal, which was considered low. In response Barrick updated and simplified the compensation program and our discussions focused on the key amendments in the new program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antipodes also voted against management on three items at Barrick's annual meeting in April 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against the proposal to approve the continued appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and to authorise the board to fix their remuneration. Whilst it is not a legal requirement for TSX listed companies it is best practice to rotate auditors and avoid excessive tenure. In this instance, PWC has been auditor since 1983.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted against the advisory vote on executive compensation approach. This vote is in line with our prior engagement with the company. In particular, the length of the compensation programs will not cover the period of investment the company is about to undertake with Reko Diq. Whilst there has been some improvement with transparency, the compensation system needs to better reflect and align with a risky greenfield investment program out to 2030.\n",
      "- Antipodes voted for a shareholder proposal to commission an independent third-party audit of environmental water impacts. A vote for this item goes against management's recommendation. Barrick has faced increased scrutiny on water and community impacts. As such further third-party studies would help to ascertain the full impacts of the company's increased focus on community engagement and reduced environmental impact and alleviate concerns.\n",
      "\n",

One example is the successful MaPrimeRenov programme in France, which incentivises renovations, as well as evolving minimum energy efficiency standards. The implications of not meeting such standards are severe, with substantial fines and restrictions on renting or selling unrenovated properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2022, we engaged with the company's investor relations team as part of the investment process. The team highlighted Saint Gobain's strong ESG credentials - sustainable construction is essential to a net-zero carbon economy. Private and public buildings are the biggest source of carbon emissions at 40%, more than industry and transport. Saint Gobain's renovation solutions are being targeted via stimulus packages and new building regulations as part of a global drive for greener, more sustainable buildings. Within this, insulation offers the highest energy efficiency returns versus alternative offerings. Saint Gobain's exposure to light and sustainable construction saves resources, time and cost versus heavy construction and enables faster construction of buildings that are needed in emerging markets.\n",
