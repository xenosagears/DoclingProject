      "Markets  have  staged  a  strong  recovery from  the  April  lows,  with  the  S&amp;P  500  up more  than  30%  and  hovering  around  alltime  highs.  Though  there  has  been  a  recent broadening out in anticipation of interest rate cuts at the Fed's September meeting, the market has been largely driven by narrow leadership tied to the AI theme. Oracle's  most  recent  quarterly  earnings  announcement  simply  underscored  this,  as the company highlighted key contract wins related to its role as a provider of AI computing  capacity  that  are  projected  to  send revenue in its cloud-computing business up 700%  over  the  next  three  years.  Shares surged  more  than  35%  and  Oracle  added approximately  $250  billion  to  its  market capitalization. AI remains very much at the forefront of investors' minds.\n",

      "However, the July and August labor reports were  disappointing.  The  July  labor  report showed  the  addition  of  73,000  jobs  but significant downward revisions to May and June  reduced  reported jobs growth for those months by a combined 258,000. The August  report  reflected  just  22,000  new jobs added versus expectations of closer to 75,000,  and  a  further  revision  lower  for June that  indicated  the  economy  lost  jobs for  the  month,  the  first  decline  since  December 2020. Job gains on average for the three months ended August have averaged just 29,000, the lowest since the pandemic. The  unemployment  rate  in  August  also ticked higher to 4.3% from 4.2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI  may  be  the  dominant  theme,  but  markets have also responded to increased expectations for rate cuts following soft labor reports in July and August. Smaller capitalization companies, which generally are more indebted and therefore stand to benefit  from  lower  rates,  have  begun  to  perk up.  Since  the  beginning  of  August,  the Russell  2000  has  outpaced  the  S&amp;P  500, but the small cap benchmark remains well behind  the  traditional  benchmark  for  the year.\n",

      "Until recently, the Fed perceived balanced risks related to both sides of its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The softening in the labor market was further  underscored  by  revised  job  numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing  the  U.S.  added  911,000  fewer jobs  over  the  12  months  ended  in  March, versus a prior indication of 1.79 million jobs added  over  that  time.  Given  the  building evidence the labor market has been much weaker  than  previously  thought,  the  next labor report on October 3rd will be closely watched.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  a  nod  toward  its  rising  concern  about increasing  labor  market  risks,  the  Fed  reduced  rates  by  0.25%  in  September  and projects  two  more  0.25%  cuts  this  year. The  market  is  generally  aligned  with  this outlook. Fed projections from the September meeting show a median expected neu-\n",

      "Despite  increased  concerns  surrounding employment, bullish stock market behavior leading into the September Fed meeting is indicative  of  a  belief  the  Fed  will  move quickly enough to keep the economy from falling  into  a  recession.  This  also  leads  to the somewhat unusual scenario where rates are being reduced while markets are near  all-time  highs  and  earnings  are  projected to continue on a solid growth trajectory.  Rate  cuts  have  generally  been  positive for markets outside of recessions.

Longer-term  inflation  expectations  remain anchored, but inflation readings continue to run above the Fed's 2% target. In August, the  core  Consumer  Price  Index  excluding food and energy rose 3.1% versus the prior year,  in  line  with  expectations.  In  the  12 months through August, the ProducerPrice  Index  was  more  encouraging,  up 2.6%. Based on the CPI and PPI data for August,  the  Fed's  preferred  measure  of inflation,  the  core  Personal  Consumption Expenditures  price index is forecast to have increased 2.9% on a 12-month basis in  August,  in  line  with  July.  Tariffs  complicate  the  inflation  outlook,  but  Fed  Chair Jerome  Powell  more  recently  suggested the effects of tariffs on goods prices would probably be relatively short-lived, while simultaneously acknowledging the possibility  tariffs  could  result  in  a  more  lasting  inflation problem, even if that is not his base case.\n",

The  metal  is up approximately 40% so far this year and has also benefited as  short-  and  long-term  rates  have  come down. The yield on the two-year  Treasury has  dropped  to  approximately  3.5%  from 4.25%  at  the  start  of  the  year,  while  the yield on the 10-year Treasury has declined from 4.6% to 4.0%.

Given the importance of the AI  theme,  any  disruption  to  the  narrative would weigh on stocks more broadly. Signs the  economy  is  cooling  faster  than  expected,  or  that  the  Fed  is  not  responding quickly enough to further weakening in the labor market, or if inflation starts marching higher,  would  also  present  headwinds  for equity  investors.  Geopolitical  issues  also remain in the mix. Uncertainty continues to build  at  the  same  time  valuations  are  elevated. A reasonable case can be made in favor  of  continued  market  strength  on  the back of the AI theme and rising corporate earnings, but additional caution also seems prudent in the current environment.\n",

      "Management noted similar past trends have been cyclical and it expects this trend to  ultimately  reverse.

      "The Charles Schwab Corp. has  been  at the forefront of major changes in the brokerage industry over the past six decades. It  was  among  the  very  first  to  offer  discounted brokerage commissions when the Securities and Exchange Commission abolished the old fixed-fee system in favor of  market  competition  on  May  1,  1975. More than 30 years ago it led the development of a service model dedicated to independent investment advisors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Schwab Advisor Services constitutes over 40% of the assets under Schwab 's custody. The  firm was  also among  the  first  to  eliminate  commissions on most stock trades in the fall of 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, investors have focused on other firms competing on margin rates and cryptocurrency  trading,  but Schwab has been closing the gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schwab 's  decision  to  eliminate  commissions triggered a chain of events that ultimately led to the acquisition of rival brokerage  TD  Ameritrade  in  October  2020.  TD Ameritrade  had  been  dependent  on  the revenue  generated  by  trading  commissions, so the massive change in the competitive landscape weakened TD and drove the firm into Schwab 's arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schwab was better equipped to thrive in a zero-commission  environment  because  it owns a bank, The Charles Schwab Bank . Uninvested  customer  cash  balances  are swept  into Schwab  Bank rather  than  a money market fund. Schwab Bank invests this  money and keeps the net investment income after paying accountholders whatever it chooses to pay. Money is invested in marketable securities, home loans, and loans  secured  by  investment  portfolios. Unlike most banks, Schwab Bank has only\n",
      "\n",
      "a  small  traditional  loan  portfolio,  primarily first mortgages and home equity loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schwab makes  money  in  four  ways.  Almost half of its revenue comes from net interest income from the bank. Second is asset  management  and  administration  fees (27%  of  total  revenue)  on  its  proprietary and  third-party  investment  products,  and fees earned from customers asking for retail  investment  advice.  Trading  revenue (16%)  represents  commissions  and  payment for order flow on equity, option, fixed income, and mutual fund transactions. The remaining  8%  of  revenue  is  derived  from other revenue sources including bank deposit  and  account  fees  from  former  TD Ameritrade customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midway  through the integration of  TD Ameritrade,  rising  interest  rates  began  to 's  business model.  Customers  started  to  move  idle 's bank sweep product into  higher-yielding  money  market  funds, CDs, bonds, and bond mutual funds. These Schwab compared to the bank sweep product. This customer cash realignment forced the firm pose  a  challenge  for Schwab cash out of Schwab products  earn  less  money  for to  seek  out  higher  cost  borrowings  to  replace cheap deposits in order to avoid selling securities at a loss. Its net interest margin fell sharply, as did its profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schwab is now on the upside of that valley. Its  net  interest  margin began rising in the second half of 2024 as maturing low-yielding securities are replaced by higher-yielding assets or used to pay down high-cost debt. Schwab management forecasts that its net interest  margin  should  average 2.80% in the fourth quarter from 2.65% in the  second  quarter.  At  the  same  time,  it also forecasts a modest 5% increase in operating  expenses  this  year,  further  aiding earnings leverage and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "It  took  three  years  to  convert  Ameritrade accounts to the Schwab platform, leading to approximately $2.5 billion in annual cost savings  for  the  combined  company.  After\n",
      "\n",
      "taxes, this equates to an additional dollar of earnings per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term growth should be driven by several  favorable  factors. Schwab 's  net  new organic assets are projected to grow 5%7% per year. The percentage of customers paying  for  investment  advice  should  continue rising as the penetration rate of former  TD  Ameritrade  customers  closes  the gap with legacy Schwab customers. These customers are more profitable to Schwab . There is also more room for improved net interest margin. Its securities portfolio yields  less  than  2%,  well  below  available market yields. This should remain true despite  anticipated  cuts  in  the  Fed  Funds rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "We model 10% annual revenue growth, but 16% EPS growth over the next five years as a rising net interest margin and cost discipline lead to improved operating margins. Also aiding growth is a return to stock buybacks in the second quarter. In five years, EPS could be as high as $7.86. Applying the high P/E ratio of 27.8 could result in a stock  price  as  high  as  218.  Adding  in  its moderate  dividend  yield,  the  total  return could approach 20% annually. We estimate the  downside  risk  as  33%  to  62.  The  selected low price approximates both Schwab 's 52-week low and the multiple of its  low P/E of 16.5 and trailing 12 months EPS of $3.74.\n",

      "Nvidia  Corporation has  ridden  the  wave of rapid growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to unprecedented heights of valuation, becoming the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap in July. This seems outrageous,  especially  for  a  semiconductor firm in a notoriously cyclical industry whose constituents  typically  trade  below  market multiples.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the voracious appetite of AI and robust  data  center  spending  plans  from major  'hyperscalers,'  like  Microsoft,  Meta Platforms,  Alphabet  and  Amazon,  seems set  to  continue  powering Nvidia 's  rapid growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia was  founded  in  1993  by  Jensen Huang (current CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem with the vision of bringing three-dimensional (3D) graphics to the gaming market, leading to their invention of the  Graphics  Processing  Unit  (GPU)  in 1999. GPUs perform parallel processing, in contrast to the serial processing performed by Central Processing Units (CPUs), making  them  ideal  for  rapidly  capturing  and rendering gaming images.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  the  firm's  search  for  new  markets, Nvidia introduced its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) parallel computing platform and application programming interface  (API)  software  for  general  purpose,  non-graphical  computing  tasks  in 2006. CUDA enabled the company to pioneer  new  applications  and  address  markets  including  drug  discovery,  financial risk management, and cryptocurrency mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPUs are essential to creating and using\n",
      "\n",
      "October 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "AI's  Large  Language  Models  (LLMs),  designed for natural language processing and generation.  This  is  because  parallel  processing is well suited to matrix multiplication  algorithms,  the  foundation  of  LLMs. Nvidia 's leadership in AI is a function of its cutting-edge  GPUs.  AI's  meteoric  growth now  dominates  the  business,  with  data center making up 88% of total fiscal second quarter revenue of $46.7 billion and gaming, professional visualization, automotive, and robotics the remaining 12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI development has two phases. The first is  AI  training.  In  this  phase,  LLMs  are trained on massive amounts of data to adjust their internal parameters, which define the model's knowledge, capability, and accuracy. To achieve more accurate models, the number of parameters has increased to the trillions. Creating larger models trained with more data requires massive amounts of computing that only data centers equipped with GPUs can provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second AI phase is inference, the process of using a trained AI model to analyze new, unseen data and make predictions or decisions. While training is seen as a onetime endeavor, inference is ongoing based on  the  volume  of  queries.  Further,  inference is evolving as AI model builders are adding  reasoning  techniques  to  existing models, requiring additional computing resources. For example, a model may be provided with additional data from the user to adjust  its  parameters,  facilitating  another round  of  computing  with  the  new  information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia 's CUDA is the software architecture of  choice  for  AI  professionals  who  have years  of  experience  using  the  platform  to build  their  models.  Because  CUDA  only runs on Nvidia GPUs, the combination has created high customer switching costs for competitors.  It isn't likely that Nvidia 's dominance in training will be unseated anytime soon, although Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD)  is  releasing  its  MI400  series GPU and upgraded AI software next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "While training  is  critical  to  build  more  sophisticated  AI  models,  demand  for  inference is exploding as use cases proliferate and  reasoning  causes  models  to  utilize more computing to provide more accurate answers. Nvidia has  more  competition  in inference, including custom chips made for hyperscalers  that  cost  less  than Nvidia GPUs and are optimized for  performance of a particular task, like serving up an advertisement on Meta Platform's Facebook. Even so, Nvidia is a likely winner in AI inference as its GPUs are repurposed, and the company uses knowledge gained from training  to  release  more  innovative  inference products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major hyperscalers are expected to spend around  $300-$335  billion  on  capital  expenditures in 2025 as they respond to market demand for Cloud computing. Some of this  spending  supports  the  continued  migration of enterprises to the Cloud, a trend that  should  continue  absent  AI.  However, AI is accelerating Cloud migration as existing enterprise data centers do not contain the GPUs needed for AI. Nvidia estimates AI data center capital expenditures of $3$4 trillion by the end of the decade based on its market signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "To meet this demand Nvidia is expanding its  capabilities  in  the  data  center  beyond GPUs.  It  purchased  Mellanox  in  2020  to gain  access  to  InfiniBand,  a  high-performance, low-latency and reliable networking protocol designed for supercomputing and AI clusters. It incorporated networking capabilities  gained  from  InfiniBand  to  introduce Spectrum Ethernet, a plug and play\n",
      "\n",
      "architecture for the more popular Ethernet data  center  networking  protocol.  To  drive better  AI  performance, Nvidia introduced NVLink, a high-speed interconnect technology that links GPUs in a cluster for faster communication speeds and memory sharing.  In  the  fiscal  second  quarter the  company generated $7.3 billion in revenue from networking, up 98% and 18% of the firm's $41.1 billion of data center revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geopolitical  risks  are  a  significant  issue. U.S. tariff policy is uncertain, and Nvidia is operating under an exemption from a 100% tariff on chip purchases if suppliers implement  plans  to  build  foundries  in  the  U.S. China/U.S.  relations  are  at  historic  lows. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) makes most of Nvidia 's chips and loss of supply could occur from a China/Taiwan conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "After agreeing with the U.S. government on a 15% export tariff, Nvidia was set to sell the  H20  GPU  to  Chinese  customers,  but China's government told customers to stop purchasing the chips. Nvidia has told analysts not to assume any sales to China, but the rest of the world remains fertile ground for  the  deployment  of  sovereign  country and regional AI data centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts expect long-term earnings growth of 30%, with growth above this rate for the next two years due to visibility in data center  buildouts.  We  are  more  conservative and project 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  capped  average  high  P/E  of  45  and forecasted  EPS  of  $10.71  in  five  years could produce a high share price of 482.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  average  low  P/E  of  23.7  and  trailing twelve-month EPS of $3.51 produces a potential low share price of 83. The combination yields an upside/downside ratio of 3.2 to 1.\n",
